What is sat sangh?   
Is it meeting people with similar quest? or is it the pause that one takes to  
reconnect with his own self. If the latter is true, does that obviate the need  
to go some place for satsangh!

Satsang is being in communion with a sage/jnani or the company of sincere  
devotees. Satsang embodied on the physical plane is beneficial and a blessing  
if it arises; however, Bhagavan Sri Ramana's presence, the grace of the Self,  
is fully available in all places and at all times. You are in truth the Self,  
from which all experiences arise, hence going somewhere for satsang is  
unnecessary. Bhagavan told seekers that coming to see him physically was not  
necessary. Self-inquiry (Atma-vichara) or total surrender to the Divine were  
identified by Bhagavan as the two means of liberation (moksha), and these can  
be practiced anywhere and at any time.
