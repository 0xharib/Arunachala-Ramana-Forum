## Re:[0]Is the Body real?

What I reckon is...   
What we experience as the body, is a picture of the body which is manufactured  
out of consciuosness by the mind.   
So the answer to the question is both yes and no!   
If the body was ONLY the creation of the mind of the individual, then it  
woild dissapear when it dies.   
This does not happen! Others can observe the continued existence of the body  
when the spirit no longer is connected to it.   
However the picture of the body disapears from the spirit upon death.   
Therefore the reality of the body is similar to the reality of the picure on a  
TV screen. The picture is not the reality that it is a picture of.   
There are ways pf proving this more or less conclisively! But unfortuneately  
they are mostli illegal.

What do we mean by real? Think about this, because language has caused us to  
accept this term without fully identifying what we mean by it.   
Let us look at some other points first, before we go further into this. (I  
wish I had more time to go into this, because one could easily write a book on  
this subject, and still not cover all the implications.)   
When we look at an object, what occurs? Light reflecting from the object  
strikes the eyes and cause a signal to be sent to the brain, whch creates the  
image of that object. We perceive the object as having a certain color. But is  
this color intrinsic to the object, or is it the creation of the interaction  
between consciousness and the physical brain? Science tells us that what we  
perceive as color is a wavelength of visible light. So, the only information  
that the lightwave is carrying is it's wavelength and frequency of vibration.  
There is nothing intrinsically 'red' or 'blue' about this information.   
When we touch an object, it seems solid to us. But physics tells us that if  
we go down to the subatomic level, there is nothing solid there. Only the  
mutually repulsive force of what we call electrons keeps us from falling  
through the floor. And the subatomic particles themselves? They seem to have  
no independent existence, but exist only as an inter-relationship with  
everything else. In isolation, they exist only as probabilities of  
interaction.   
 But probabilities, like consciousness, are not a physical thing. Yet both  
seem to be the basis that the physical universe is built upon.   
 So is the universe dependent upon the consciousness of the individual?  
Apparently not, though you could build a case that since everyone's entire  
knowledge of the universe is based upon your individual consciousness, it  
would be far easier to defend this viewpoint than the independent existence of  
the universe. But it seems far more likely that the universe exists within  
the universal consciousness which we are all a part of.   
 So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space.

Yes thats more or less what I think too.   
What we percieve as colour is actuly divsion of consciuousness. The mind  
creating the experience of colour out of consciousness.   
What I was trying to get at was this issue of independant existence.   
Lsd and other true psychedelic drugs cause the image of the world to change  
and distort. But no other person perceieves this. Also after death other  
people percieve the decay of the body. These two things must lead us the  
conclusion that the material Universe has some sort of existence outside the  
mind of the observer! And we all to some extent percieve the same objects.   
So, i think you are right, it is the Universal mind. The ultimate stuff of  
the universe is consciousness. Subatomic particles and quasars, all the  
galaxies, all Universes..   
Probabilities ? If as they say its all predetermined, then maybe its all like  
a cosmic DVD playing, within the Universal mind.   
Like when you watch a movie there apear to be events, and cause and effect  
,but really its all just the one thing and the laser [ the moment NOW ] plays  
the events in sequence making them appear to happen.   
So seeing the Akashic [spellcheck ]cliche for some thing is to absorb all the  
information about it simultaneously. Past present and future all as one.   
Brilliant talk to you dedhed   
Mick   
PS   
Then theres that experience just outside Samadhi where the Universe is  
percieved within one.   
I went into a local shop and the assitant said "Have you tried the Holy herb  
of the Mastecs ? [legal] I could see the entire Universe within me"   
. He has never read any Yoga philosophy as far as know. This ties in with, ;  
page 106, chapterXVIII Self-realisation, instructions to F H Humphries. By B  
V NARASIMHA SWAMI. The quote goes.......   
Salutations to the feet of the guru Sri Dakshinamurti, who sees within himself  
the entire Universe, which resembles the image of a city in a mirror. Which  
appears to be outside of him just as objects seen in a dream are outside the  
dreamer, but which merges into himself in the state of realisation-for then he  
sees the self alone and not the objects he dreamt of."   
Its seems that the Cosmic mind has the Universe within it independant of sense  
impressiions   
This book seems to have been signed by Ramana Mahrishi himself!!!!! Its from  
the ashram in the 1930s!!!

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?  
" There are no sounds for the deaf or sights for the blind"

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look

Quote  
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.  
I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

I have a copy of Fritof Capras book "The Tao of Physics" but I havent got  
through it all.   
It seems that Hindhu sages already had relativity a long time ago.   
I think that Yoga/Hindhuism has something quite close to the big bang in it  
too.   
Cosmic exhale and inhale I believe!   
Buddha said that the world will end in fire, [Red Giant].   
................................................................................   
Its all one entity all of it!   
Its was LSD and mescaline for me !   
One experience of Samadhi and the Kundalini, never to be repeated, I tried a  
lot that way but it was a one off!!   
I saw the interelatedness of everything too!   
There must be, at some time, a convergence between physics and metaphysics!   
Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!   
Not again oh no not again!!!

Samadhi state, Past present futrure, physics mathematics, time space  
everything,   
There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding

Manickavachagar is a great Saivite saint, who wrote two groups of   
poems called Thiruvachakam and Thirukkovaiyar. The first one is   
again a collection of 51 subgroups of poems, about his life and his   
Siva-experience. Bhagavan liked this work very much and it was one   
His faourite works. He used to refer to this often in His talks and   
conversations. Bhagavan has said that Thiruvachakam has to be   
experienced and one should not try to understand this thorugh   
intellectual knowledge. I am reading Thiruvachakam since 1990.   
I had a practice of reading one sub-group per day. I went through   
David Godman's website www.davidgodman.org. today and was   
delighted to find an extensive article on the above topic, narrating   
Bhagavan's various talks which covered Thiruvachakam. Muruganar's   
Ramana Sannidhi Murai and Guruvachaka Kovai, are patterned on   
the above two groups of poems by Manickavachakar. David has also   
given a translation of Siva Puranam, the first poem of Thiruvchakam,   
after the translation of Ramana Puranam of Muruganar. I want this

experience cannot be questioned but you will agree that perhaps   
the drugs make your "way" look somewhat easier, but still the   
goal is not assured. It is like going round the Arunachala Hill,   
by car, instead of by foot. The Goal can be attained only when   
Goal wants you to attain it. Is it not? As T.S. Eliot put it: "There is a  
time, there is a time, when everything looks alike... After such   
knowledge, what forgiveness?" Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian.R   
I agree with you. However when we go somewhere it is helpful to have  
signposts to show us the way. Without those LSD experiences I would not have  
known that Samadhi was possible. Or that some of my troubles were Kundalini  
related.   
It isn't a quetion of making it easier, it's a question of belief. There is  
the Yoga idea of 3 types of knowledge The first type is, ,,, There is a flame  
there, you stick your finger in it. aaaargh !! it hurts, you know this, no  
one told you. The second type of knowledge is, ,,, Someone says to you, " If  
you sitck your finger in that flame it will hurt you " and you BELIEVE them  
.This is only belief, whether the belief is true or not it's still onle belief  
. The third type of knowledge comes from within.   
Belief causes all sorts of trouble, look at all the fake Gurus and religious  
leaders. Con men tricking people, read a few books and pretend to be a  
realised being. People believe all sorts of crazy things.   
So, maybe some personal experience however breif is worth more than reading  
books and believing people. Beings such as Ramana Maharishi are not exactly on  
every street corner !!!   
Ramana is/was 100% genuine, the real deal. But as he said Western people find  
it harder because they are more outward looking. So being given a doorway to  
your own interior can be very helpful [ to some people ]   
Peace

Dear mick, I can never question your belief. Bhagavan Ramana   
is a different person, when He was in body. He never wore sandals   
in His life. He never wore ochre robes. All His readings and writings   
were after He realized. It is like someone suddenly appearing on the   
top of a hill and then descending to the foothill to tell others His   
experience atop the hill. We are all on the foothills, trying various   
ways, various books, various Gurus, transcedental meditation and   
other types, shifting from one way to another and so on. Eventually,   
if the goal is achieved, the ways are forgotten. Is it not?   
Arunachala Siva.

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!   
Peace

Also I think that Astro Mental refers to that plane of existence where  
,Leprechauns, Fairies, or whatever they are exist. Some sort of disembodied  
minds. When aked if they exist, Ramana said they do. When asked where they are  
he replied " In you".   
Some people have had some experience of this area of the mind under the  
infuence of psychedelic drugs.   
 And very strange it is too!   
Definately not to be played with is the occult!!   
Has an astral quality which reminds one of the smell of sulphur!

Yes, I'm familiar with him, The point I was making was that talk about astral  
planes and so forth are a bunch of Theosophical doctrine that I find  
questionable, and have no need of. Mouni Sadhu, man I haven't heard that name  
in 25 years! I read his "In Days of Great Peace" when I was in high school.  
I think it was my introduction to Ramana and Sri Aurobindo. I was trying to  
remember his name a few months ago, and just couldn't do it. Thanks.   
Speaking of people with ties to Theosophy, what are your thoughts on  
Krishnamurti? I realize he hasn't been dead 50 years, but he never claimed to  
be a guru, so I suppose discussing him is alright.   
Also, have you read The Sufis by Idries Shah?

" What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS."   
What Einstein meant by relativity theory was that time and space are not  
absolutes, but ARE relative to the viewpoint of the observer. And, yes, you  
could say that light doesn't travel at all. From it's own perspective, there  
is no distance traveled, and no time passed. In a very real sense, you could  
say that it is defining distance and time. There are aspects of this that are  
unbelievably bizarre, but it would take up too much space to go into them  
here.   
One weird thing, though, is how light travels. You mentioned the key fact.  
Regardless of the movement of an object, light still moves away from it at the  
same speed. Because there is no such thing as absolute space, no absolute  
framework of space and time. We can only say objects are moving or at rest  
compared to a particular frame of reference. For instance, say an asteroid and  
the earth are on a collision course. From our frame of reference, we are at  
rest, and the asteroid is moving towards us. From the asteroids, it is at rest  
and we are moving towards it. Light does not discriminate. It merely describes  
the distance between the two objects by the time it takes to travel between  
the two, and describes the rate at which this distance is decreasing by  
shifting towards the blue end of the spectrum. Light from both objects will  
appear to have the same blue shift when observed from the other. If objects  
are moving away from each other, light shifts toward the red end of the  
spectrum.

BTW, Physicists are working very hard on a general theory to supplant  
relativity and quantum mechanics, each of which only describe things under  
different circumstances, but contradict each other in their separate spheres.  
So a Theory of Everything is needed, (TOE for short) which can describe  
everything, without having to refer to one theory under certain circumstances,  
and the other to describe events under different ones. The two major  
candidates are loop quantum gravity and string theory, but both are still very  
incomplete, and extremely complicated. And the observation that the expansion  
of the universe is speeding up instead of slowing down has further complicated  
matters. Personally, I think the final theory will incorporate parts of all  
these theories, plus consciousness. When we finally find it, I think it will  
be responsible for a quantum leap in the evolution of the consciousness of  
mankind. Which is why I consider it so important.

WHOAAA! This discussion has been awesome guys!!! Reading your posts has been  
SO cool, just want to add a thought that was conjured up in my mind   
This is regarding the no non-existence element. I was unable to tell if it  
had been resolved but i agree with the things dedhed was saying here. Non-  
existence is still a form of existence. My understanding of this goes: Consciousness has no form.   
No form = no beginning and no end.   
No beginning and no end = infinite.   
Infinite = **infinite possibility** which includes both finite and non  
infinite possibility and of course both existence and _non-existence_, lol.   
I am sure you guys have probably already contemplated this but just thought i  
would join in.   
NICE ONE

Hiya Neil   
What if there is no such thing as possibility !   
Only actuality.   
What if what IS is all there can be. So the idea of possibilities only exists  
because we don't know everything. If we knew absolutely EVERYTHING then there  
would be no possibilities, only the ALL OF EVERYTHING !!   
If time is not real, if time and space are merely apparent relativities within  
the ALL.   
Then..   
Maybe it's like the relationship between a seed and a tree !   
The seed doesn't cause the tree the seed IS the tree at a different time in  
it's developement.   
This is true if time really PASSES   
,However if the begining and end of time exist SIMULTANEUOSLY in a non  
temporal dimenesion.   
Then we only see the passage of time because of the way our minds function.   
Like, for instance, when we watch a DVD we see the events recorded as a  
sequence of events. But all the events on the DVD exist SIMULTANEOUSLY ! The  
begining and end are ALWAYS there.   
In this metaphor the passage of time is represented by the rotation of the DVD  
disc and the tracking of the information by the Laser.   
The SELF is the whole DVD disc. It has the whole story printed on it all at  
once. This would explain predestination, and the saying that ones destiny is  
on you brow. It would also explain clairvovance, deja vu and a lot of other  
aparently occult phenomena.   
Peace, love and do the Watusi [ random 1950s dance craze lol !!!!]

Dear Mick Hutchinson and dedhead, I have been reading the   
exchange of views between both of you. I have not read David   
Chalmers. Please tell the full titles of his books and names of   
publishers. Meantime, I remember to have read "The Outsider"   
\- by Colin Wilson, a non-fiction. It does not deal with science but   
with phenomenological problems of existence. Today, I read an   
extract from Moor Nom, in internet with the title, "The Trial of Adi  
Sankara." I read only a small portion sent by my son from Singapore, as   
a part of e mail. I would, on getting the web address of Moor Nam, will   
post it through Forum. Moor Nom says, that all the world communities   
were, in the beginning, work-centric and whenever they raised their   
heads, they was the sun and started praying to the Sun. Worship-   
centric religion and with it, history-centric relgion came much later,   
with pyramids, mounains and rivers and temples. Someone like Buddha   
came later,and made it totally philosphy-oriented. This concept also   
waned in due course and there should be something which could admix   
both philosophy-orientation and history-orientation, and this is what   
Shankara did. When he allowed worship, ( He did not allow anyway,   
worship of dead man's clothes, sandals or teeth), he limited the   
work-centric behaviour to pitru-karma (No birth anniversaries!), and the  
worship to temples and chanting of mantras and slokas and went about  
elaborately to philosophy-centric methods like "Atma Vichara'. I request Mick  
Hutchinson, dedhead and other Forum-members to look into   
David Chalmers and Moor Nom, in juxtaposition and send their views.

I wonder if Ramana was Shankara reincarnated, It would explain Ramana's sudden  
enlightenment. He just allowed himself to be reborn, from compasion. Not from  
the thought" I will return ",but because it was the nature of his love to do  
so.   
Maybe we'll never know.

Dear mick, I saw your two postings. It is only for us, from Kavyakanta   
Ganapati Muni to today's Forum members, that one has to subcribe that   
Bhagavan is an 'avatara' of Shankara. Ramana Gita begins saying   
that "You are the avatara" of Lord Skanda. Ganaputi Muni also says   
that Bhagavan is an "avatara" of Jnana-Sambandha, another 7th   
century Tamil Saivite-poet. The story goes that when Jnana Sambandha   
was a three year old child, and when he was crying on the banks of a tank in  
Sirkali (a famous temple-town in Tamil Nadu), Uma appeared with Siva and gave  
Her breast-milk to the child. The three year child then   
began singing, "Oh Siva, wearing studs on your ears, you came on a bull   
with your consort and stole away my mind..." Kavyakanta gives three   
'mantras' for invoking Bhagavan Ramana:- (1) Om vacat bhuve! (the   
Effulgent), (2) Om Saravana Bhava (the god born on saravana-pond)   
(3) Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya. Kapali Sastri, who has written   
a Sanskrit commentary (which was read out in the presence of Bhagavan   
Ramana and approved by Him) on Ramana Gita, gives meanings and   
descriptions of these three mantras. In the end Bhagavan is neither

Dear mick and dedhead, Being Sunday, I was once again reading   
the complete exchange of views between you two right from Jan 2007.   
Ultimately, existence and non-existence seem to me the both sides of   
the same coin. Elders who knew it, perhaps, called it Existence   
Knowledge and Bliss, to sound more positive, because the title, Non-Existence,  
Non-Knowledge and Non-Bliss, will not matter anything to   
Existence, but only to us. Sankara did not object to Buddha calling It,   
as Maha-Sunya, but only said, that, since the Realized Souls exhibit  
absolute compassion (which can arise only out of happiness), Maha-   
Karuna (as even Zen masters say), it is better to call it as EKB. than   
NE-NK-NB. I also believe that till the end of this universe, no intelligent   
being, can discover what is Consciousness, what is its structure, formula,  
chemistry and physics of it, because Consciousness cannot be described   
or explained by anyone from outside, since it is experience not ratio-   
cination. Even under experience, one cannot reach the realms of   
consciousness through psychedelic drugs. I did not try LSD and mescaline but  
tried an Indian drug called Lorazepam. A 4 mg dose of it will give   
8 hours sleep. But I had 20 mg during day time. It did not take me any-   
where, but to sleepless stupor. People living earlier than 20th century   
had tried desi types like cannabin, ganja, "umanthankaai " etc., Why, even  
during Ramana's time, some visitors had used ganja to attain realization  
Bhagavan used to caution them against such practices! Incidentally Appayya  
Dikshitar, a great Sanskrit poet of 18th century, an ardent Shiva devotee,  
asked his disciples to give him a generous dose   
"umanthankaai " and sang 500 Sanskrit songs on Shiva during that   
near-mad state! This poem is called "Unmantha-pancha-sat" meaning   
"500 poems of a madcap". Arunachala Siva.

Hey Nell, "no beginning= no end = infinite". You have rediscovered   
Gaudapada, (Sankara's teacher's teacher)!! He said exactly the   
the same thing in his famous Gaudapada Karika, a Sanskrit verse-   
commentary on Maandukya Upanisad. This is called "no creation=   
no dissolution = Existence-Knowledge-Bliss. Incidentally Maandukya   
is the smallest Upanisad with 20 verses and the commentary is of   
about 250 verses. Sankara wrote a more detailed commentary   
on MU and GK. Arunachala Siva.

Dear mick and dedhead, I had also read a lot of J Krishnamurti,   
and attended his December lectures in Madras (now Chennai). A   
news item appeared after his death telling about his relationship   
with Ms. Rosalind Rajagopal, his disciple's wife. After knowing   
that he was "mere prattle without practice", I dumped his books   
in my attic.

Nice talking to you Subramanian.   
One day the truth out, to be known by all, cannabis isn't a psychedelic drug  
,It's better than Alcohol because it makes on more inward looking but it's  
just a drug   
Are you familiar with the writings of Mouni Sadhu ?   
He was a disciple of Sri Ramana. If you read page 346 of his book Meditation  
you will see that he had the same experience looking into Ramana's eyes as he  
had when he later took LSD.   
The world that we seem to see aound us bends the floor waves, so the world  
can't be real because if what we are seeing is the solid reality that it seems  
then it could'nt change shape like that. However true mystical experience is  
rare and heaven and hell are both inner states. My only experience of Samadhi  
was in 1970 on strawberry fields LSD. a rapid and completely ecstatic rising  
of the Kundalini preceded it.   
I later took LSD about 500 times and the experience was never repeated.   
On 3 other occasions I feel that had I surrenedered it would have happened but  
I was overcome by the fear of death.   
Since the 1960s India has had people coming to find Gurus and study Yoga  
because of LSD.   
I must also say that I have had some extremely horrible experiences on LSD  
,but it's a paper tiger and does no harm.   
That was some time ago and I am getting old. I am not advising anyone to take  
it or break the law. But LSD answered all my questions and drew me to Ramana  
Maharishi. It is not for everyone and large doses first time are a very bad  
idea. It must be taken in a quiet place with friends.   
No drug even LSD can give Self Realisation but a temporary experience means  
that you know where to look to find your way back   
One day the truth will out.   
Peace. love and understanding

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?  
" There are no sounds for the deaf or sights for the blind"

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

I have a copy of Fritof Capras book "The Tao of Physics" but I havent got  
through it all.   
It seems that Hindhu sages already had relativity a long time ago.   
I think that Yoga/Hindhuism has something quite close to the big bang in it  
too.   
Cosmic exhale and inhale I believe!   
Buddha said that the world will end in fire, [Red Giant].   
................................................................................   
Its all one entity all of it!   
Its was LSD and mescaline for me !   
One experience of Samadhi and the Kundalini, never to be repeated, I tried a  
lot that way but it was a one off!!   
I saw the interelatedness of everything too!   
There must be, at some time, a convergence between physics and metaphysics!   
Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!   
Not again oh no not again!!!

everything,   
There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

I have a copy of Fritof Capras book "The Tao of Physics" but I havent got  
through it all.   
It seems that Hindhu sages already had relativity a long time ago.   
I think that Yoga/Hindhuism has something quite close to the big bang in it  
too.   
Cosmic exhale and inhale I believe!

Its all one entity all of it!

One experience of Samadhi and the Kundalini, never to be repeated, I tried a  
lot that way but it was a one off!!   
I saw the interelatedness of everything too!   
There must be, at some time, a convergence between physics and metaphysics!   
Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!

everything,   
There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?  
" There are no sounds for the deaf or sights for the blind"

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

I have a copy of Fritof Capras book "The Tao of Physics" but I havent got  
through it all.   
It seems that Hindhu sages already had relativity a long time ago.   
I think that Yoga/Hindhuism has something quite close to the big bang in it  
too.   
Cosmic exhale and inhale I believe!   
Buddha said that the world will end in fire, [Red Giant].   
................................................................................   
Its all one entity all of it!   
Its was LSD and mescaline for me !   
One experience of Samadhi and the Kundalini, never to be repeated, I tried a  
lot that way but it was a one off!!   
I saw the interelatedness of everything too!   
There must be, at some time, a convergence between physics and metaphysics!   
Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!   
Not again oh no not again!!!

everything,   
There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?  
" There are no sounds for the deaf or sights for the blind"

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of

I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

I have a copy of Fritof Capras book "The Tao of Physics" but I havent got  
through it all.   
It seems that Hindhu sages already had relativity a long time ago.   
I think that Yoga/Hindhuism has something quite close to the big bang in it  
too.   
Cosmic exhale and inhale I believe!   
Buddha said that the world will end in fire, [Red Giant].   
................................................................................   
Its all one entity all of it!   
Its was LSD and mescaline for me !   
One experience of Samadhi and the Kundalini, never to be repeated, I tried a  
lot that way but it was a one off!!   
I saw the interelatedness of everything too!   
There must be, at some time, a convergence between physics and metaphysics!   
Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!   
Not again oh no not again!!!

Samadhi state, Past present futrure, physics mathematics, time space  
everything,   
There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?

So really we should not say I am in the world, we should say the world is in  
me!!   
Thats hard to see.   
And hard to be!!!   
How strange is that ?   
Its hard to be what we already are and cant stop being even if we try!!

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!   
Not again oh no not again!!!

Also I reckon that all the information about everything is there in the  
Samadhi state, Past present futrure, physics mathematics, time space  
everything,   
There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

Its like everything is known all at once, simultaneuosly, without thought or

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding   
Mick

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?  
" There are no sounds for the deaf or sights for the blind"

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

I have a copy of Fritof Capras book "The Tao of Physics" but I havent got  
through it all.   
It seems that Hindhu sages already had relativity a long time ago.   
I think that Yoga/Hindhuism has something quite close to the big bang in it  
too.   
Cosmic exhale and inhale I believe!   
Buddha said that the world will end in fire, [Red Giant].   
................................................................................   
Its all one entity all of it!   
Its was LSD and mescaline for me !   
One experience of Samadhi and the Kundalini, never to be repeated, I tried a  
lot that way but it was a one off!!   
I saw the interelatedness of everything too!   
There must be, at some time, a convergence between physics and metaphysics!   
Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!   
Not again oh no not again!!!

everything,   
There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

I have a copy of Fritof Capras book "The Tao of Physics" but I havent got  
through it all.   
It seems that Hindhu sages already had relativity a long time ago.   
I think that Yoga/Hindhuism has something quite close to the big bang in it  
too.   
Cosmic exhale and inhale I believe!   
Buddha said that the world will end in fire, [Red Giant].   
................................................................................   
Its all one entity all of it!   
Its was LSD and mescaline for me !   
One experience of Samadhi and the Kundalini, never to be repeated, I tried a  
lot that way but it was a one off!!   
I saw the interelatedness of everything too!   
There must be, at some time, a convergence between physics and metaphysics!   
Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!   
Not again oh no not again!!!

There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?  
" There are no sounds for the deaf or sights for the blind"

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

I have a copy of Fritof Capras book "The Tao of Physics" but I havent got  
through it all.   
It seems that Hindhu sages already had relativity a long time ago.   
I think that Yoga/Hindhuism has something quite close to the big bang in it  
too.   
Cosmic exhale and inhale I believe!   
Buddha said that the world will end in fire, [Red Giant].   
................................................................................   
Its all one entity all of it!   
Its was LSD and mescaline for me !   
One experience of Samadhi and the Kundalini, never to be repeated, I tried a  
lot that way but it was a one off!!   
I saw the interelatedness of everything too!   
There must be, at some time, a convergence between physics and metaphysics!   
Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!   
Not again oh no not again!!!

everything,   
There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?  
" There are no sounds for the deaf or sights for the blind"

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

I have a copy of Fritof Capras book "The Tao of Physics" but I havent got  
through it all.   
It seems that Hindhu sages already had relativity a long time ago.   
I think that Yoga/Hindhuism has something quite close to the big bang in it  
too.   
Cosmic exhale and inhale I believe!   
Buddha said that the world will end in fire, [Red Giant].   
................................................................................   
Its all one entity all of it!   
Its was LSD and mescaline for me !   
One experience of Samadhi and the Kundalini, never to be repeated, I tried a  
lot that way but it was a one off!!   
I saw the interelatedness of everything too!   
There must be, at some time, a convergence between physics and metaphysics!   
Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!   
Not again oh no not again!!!

everything,   
There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?  
" There are no sounds for the deaf or sights for the blind"

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

I have a copy of Fritof Capras book "The Tao of Physics" but I havent got  
through it all.   
It seems that Hindhu sages already had relativity a long time ago.   
I think that Yoga/Hindhuism has something quite close to the big bang in it  
too.   
Cosmic exhale and inhale I believe!   
Buddha said that the world will end in fire, [Red Giant].   
................................................................................   
Its all one entity all of it!   
Its was LSD and mescaline for me !   
One experience of Samadhi and the Kundalini, never to be repeated, I tried a  
lot that way but it was a one off!!   
I saw the interelatedness of everything too!   
There must be, at some time, a convergence between physics and metaphysics!   
Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!   
Not again oh no not again!!!

Also I reckon that all the information about everything is there in the  
Samadhi state, Past present futrure, physics mathematics, time space  
everything,   
There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

Its like everything is known all at once, simultaneuosly, without thought or

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?  
" There are no sounds for the deaf or sights for the blind"

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

I have a copy of Fritof Capras book "The Tao of Physics" but I havent got  
through it all.   
It seems that Hindhu sages already had relativity a long time ago.   
I think that Yoga/Hindhuism has something quite close to the big bang in it  
too.   
Cosmic exhale and inhale I believe!   
Buddha said that the world will end in fire, [Red Giant].   
................................................................................   
Its all one entity all of it!   
Its was LSD and mescaline for me !   
One experience of Samadhi and the Kundalini, never to be repeated, I tried a  
lot that way but it was a one off!!   
I saw the interelatedness of everything too!   
There must be, at some time, a convergence between physics and metaphysics!   
Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!   
Not again oh no not again!!!

everything,   
There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

I have a copy of Fritof Capras book "The Tao of Physics" but I havent got  
through it all.   
It seems that Hindhu sages already had relativity a long time ago.   
I think that Yoga/Hindhuism has something quite close to the big bang in it  
too.   
Cosmic exhale and inhale I believe!   
Buddha said that the world will end in fire, [Red Giant].   
................................................................................   
Its all one entity all of it!   
Its was LSD and mescaline for me !   
One experience of Samadhi and the Kundalini, never to be repeated, I tried a  
lot that way but it was a one off!!   
I saw the interelatedness of everything too!   
There must be, at some time, a convergence between physics and metaphysics!   
Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!

There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?  
" There are no sounds for the deaf or sights for the blind"

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

I have a copy of Fritof Capras book "The Tao of Physics" but I havent got  
through it all.   
It seems that Hindhu sages already had relativity a long time ago.   
I think that Yoga/Hindhuism has something quite close to the big bang in it  
too.   
Cosmic exhale and inhale I believe!   
Buddha said that the world will end in fire, [Red Giant].   
................................................................................   
Its all one entity all of it!   
Its was LSD and mescaline for me !   
One experience of Samadhi and the Kundalini, never to be repeated, I tried a  
lot that way but it was a one off!!   
I saw the interelatedness of everything too!   
There must be, at some time, a convergence between physics and metaphysics!   
Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!   
Not again oh no not again!!!

everything,   
There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?  
" There are no sounds for the deaf or sights for the blind"

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

I have a copy of Fritof Capras book "The Tao of Physics" but I havent got  
through it all.   
It seems that Hindhu sages already had relativity a long time ago.   
I think that Yoga/Hindhuism has something quite close to the big bang in it  
too.   
Cosmic exhale and inhale I believe!   
Buddha said that the world will end in fire, [Red Giant].

Its all one entity all of it!   
Its was LSD and mescaline for me !   
One experience of Samadhi and the Kundalini, never to be repeated, I tried a  
lot that way but it was a one off!!   
I saw the interelatedness of everything too!   
There must be, at some time, a convergence between physics and metaphysics!   
Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!

There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding

How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?  
" There are no sounds for the deaf or sights for the blind"

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

I have a copy of Fritof Capras book "The Tao of Physics" but I havent got  
through it all.   
It seems that Hindhu sages already had relativity a long time ago.   
I think that Yoga/Hindhuism has something quite close to the big bang in it  
too.   
Cosmic exhale and inhale I believe!   
Buddha said that the world will end in fire, [Red Giant].   
................................................................................   
Its all one entity all of it!   
Its was LSD and mescaline for me !   
One experience of Samadhi and the Kundalini, never to be repeated, I tried a  
lot that way but it was a one off!!   
I saw the interelatedness of everything too!   
There must be, at some time, a convergence between physics and metaphysics!   
Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!   
Not again oh no not again!!!

Also I reckon that all the information about everything is there in the  
Samadhi state, Past present futrure, physics mathematics, time space  
everything,   
There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!

Its like everything is known all at once, simultaneuosly, without thought or

Knowiing all and knowing nothing.

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the Pāramārthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the Vyāvahārika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the Prāthibhāsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines  
its light on all of the DVD simultaneuously!!

Or   
Time lapse photography shows a completely different picture of, for instance  
the nature of objects.   
If we only slightly change the rate at which we percieve events , what we  
percieve drastically alters. This is to bolster the CAKE metaphor.

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

"In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines  
its light on all of the DVD simultaneuously!!

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines

Time lapse photography shows a completely different picture of, for instance

If we only slightly change the rate at which we percieve events , what we

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines  
its light on all of the DVD simultaneuously!!

Time lapse photography shows a completely different picture of, for instance

If we only slightly change the rate at which we percieve events , what we  
percieve drastically alters. This is to bolster the CAKE metaphor.

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

"In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines  
its light on all of the DVD simultaneuously!!

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines  
its light on all of the DVD simultaneuously!!

Time lapse photography shows a completely different picture of, for instance  
the nature of objects.   
If we only slightly change the rate at which we percieve events , what we

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

"In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Dear mick, You have yourself said that LSD and other such   
drugs will not give realization. Sadhu Om's experience and your   
experience cannot be questioned but you will agree that perhaps   
the drugs make your "way" look somewhat easier, but still the   
goal is not assured. It is like going round the Arunachala Hill,   
by car, instead of by foot. The Goal can be attained only when   
Goal wants you to attain it. Is it not? As T.S. Eliot put it: "There is a  
time, there is a time, when everything looks alike... After such   
knowledge, what forgiveness?" Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian.R   
I agree with you. However when we go somewhere it is helpful to have  
signposts to show us the way. Without those LSD experiences I would not have  
known that Samadhi was possible. Or that some of my troubles were Kundalini  
related.   
It isn't a quetion of making it easier, it's a question of belief. There is  
the Yoga idea of 3 types of knowledge The first type is, ,,, There is a flame  
there, you stick your finger in it. aaaargh !! it hurts, you know this, no  
one told you. The second type of knowledge is, ,,, Someone says to you, " If  
you sitck your finger in that flame it will hurt you " and you BELIEVE them  
.This is only belief, whether the belief is true or not it's still onle belief  
. The third type of knowledge comes from within.   
Belief causes all sorts of trouble, look at all the fake Gurus and religious  
leaders. Con men tricking people, read a few books and pretend to be a  
realised being. People believe all sorts of crazy things.   
So, maybe some personal experience however breif is worth more than reading  
books and believing people. Beings such as Ramana Maharishi are not exactly on  
every street corner !!!   
Ramana is/was 100% genuine, the real deal. But as he said Western people find  
it harder because they are more outward looking. So being given a doorway to  
your own interior can be very helpful [ to some people ]

Dear mick, I can never question your belief. Bhagavan Ramana   
is a different person, when He was in body. He never wore sandals   
in His life. He never wore ochre robes. All His readings and writings   
were after He realized. It is like someone suddenly appearing on the   
top of a hill and then descending to the foothill to tell others His   
experience atop the hill. We are all on the foothills, trying various   
ways, various books, various Gurus, transcedental meditation and   
other types, shifting from one way to another and so on. Eventually,   
if the goal is achieved, the ways are forgotten. Is it not?   
Arunachala Siva.

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!   
Peace

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines  
its light on all of the DVD simultaneuously!!

Time lapse photography shows a completely different picture of, for instance  
the nature of objects.   
If we only slightly change the rate at which we percieve events , what we  
percieve drastically alters. This is to bolster the CAKE metaphor.

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

"In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines  
its light on all of the DVD simultaneuously!!

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines

Time lapse photography shows a completely different picture of, for instance

If we only slightly change the rate at which we percieve events , what we

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!   
Peace

Also I think that Astro Mental refers to that plane of existence where  
,Leprechauns, Fairies, or whatever they are exist. Some sort of disembodied  
minds. When aked if they exist, Ramana said they do. When asked where they are  
he replied " In you".   
Some people have had some experience of this area of the mind under the

Yes, I'm familiar with him, The point I was making was that talk about astral  
planes and so forth are a bunch of Theosophical doctrine that I find  
questionable, and have no need of. Mouni Sadhu, man I haven't heard that name  
in 25 years! I read his "In Days of Great Peace" when I was in high school.  
I think it was my introduction to Ramana and Sri Aurobindo. I was trying to  
remember his name a few months ago, and just couldn't do it. Thanks.   
Speaking of people with ties to Theosophy, what are your thoughts on  
Krishnamurti? I realize he hasn't been dead 50 years, but he never claimed to  
be a guru, so I suppose discussing him is alright.

" What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS."   
What Einstein meant by relativity theory was that time and space are not  
absolutes, but ARE relative to the viewpoint of the observer. And, yes, you  
could say that light doesn't travel at all. From it's own perspective, there  
is no distance traveled, and no time passed. In a very real sense, you could  
say that it is defining distance and time. There are aspects of this that are  
unbelievably bizarre, but it would take up too much space to go into them  
here.   
One weird thing, though, is how light travels. You mentioned the key fact.  
Regardless of the movement of an object, light still moves away from it at the  
same speed. Because there is no such thing as absolute space, no absolute  
framework of space and time. We can only say objects are moving or at rest  
compared to a particular frame of reference. For instance, say an asteroid and  
the earth are on a collision course. From our frame of reference, we are at  
rest, and the asteroid is moving towards us. From the asteroids, it is at rest  
and we are moving towards it. Light does not discriminate. It merely describes  
the distance between the two objects by the time it takes to travel between  
the two, and describes the rate at which this distance is decreasing by  
shifting towards the blue end of the spectrum. Light from both objects will  
appear to have the same blue shift when observed from the other. If objects  
are moving away from each other, light shifts toward the red end of the  
spectrum.

BTW, Physicists are working very hard on a general theory to supplant  
relativity and quantum mechanics, each of which only describe things under  
different circumstances, but contradict each other in their separate spheres.  
So a Theory of Everything is needed, (TOE for short) which can describe  
everything, without having to refer to one theory under certain circumstances,  
and the other to describe events under different ones. The two major  
candidates are loop quantum gravity and string theory, but both are still very  
incomplete, and extremely complicated. And the observation that the expansion  
of the universe is speeding up instead of slowing down has further complicated  
matters. Personally, I think the final theory will incorporate parts of all  
these theories, plus consciousness. When we finally find it, I think it will  
be responsible for a quantum leap in the evolution of the consciousness of  
mankind. Which is why I consider it so important.

BTW, Physicists are working very hard on a general theory to supplant  
relativity and quantum mechanics, each of which only describe things under  
different circumstances, but contradict each other in their separate spheres.  
So a Theory of Everything is needed, (TOE for short) which can describe  
everything, without having to refer to one theory under certain circumstances,  
and the other to describe events under different ones. The two major  
candidates are loop quantum gravity and string theory, but both are still very  
incomplete, and extremely complicated. And the observation that the expansion  
of the universe is speeding up instead of slowing down has further complicated  
matters. Personally, I think the final theory will incorporate parts of all  
these theories, plus consciousness. When we finally find it, I think it will  
be responsible for a quantum leap in the evolution of the consciousness of  
mankind. Which is why I consider it so important.

Yes, I'm familiar with him, The point I was making was that talk about astral  
planes and so forth are a bunch of Theosophical doctrine that I find  
questionable, and have no need of. Mouni Sadhu, man I haven't heard that name  
in 25 years! I read his "In Days of Great Peace" when I was in high school.  
I think it was my introduction to Ramana and Sri Aurobindo. I was trying to  
remember his name a few months ago, and just couldn't do it. Thanks.   
Speaking of people with ties to Theosophy, what are your thoughts on  
Krishnamurti? I realize he hasn't been dead 50 years, but he never claimed to  
be a guru, so I suppose discussing him is alright.   
Also, have you read The Sufis by Idries Shah?

" What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS."   
What Einstein meant by relativity theory was that time and space are not  
absolutes, but ARE relative to the viewpoint of the observer. And, yes, you  
could say that light doesn't travel at all. From it's own perspective, there  
is no distance traveled, and no time passed. In a very real sense, you could  
say that it is defining distance and time. There are aspects of this that are  
unbelievably bizarre, but it would take up too much space to go into them  
here.   
One weird thing, though, is how light travels. You mentioned the key fact.  
Regardless of the movement of an object, light still moves away from it at the  
same speed. Because there is no such thing as absolute space, no absolute  
framework of space and time. We can only say objects are moving or at rest  
compared to a particular frame of reference. For instance, say an asteroid and  
the earth are on a collision course. From our frame of reference, we are at  
rest, and the asteroid is moving towards us. From the asteroids, it is at rest  
and we are moving towards it. Light does not discriminate. It merely describes  
the distance between the two objects by the time it takes to travel between  
the two, and describes the rate at which this distance is decreasing by  
shifting towards the blue end of the spectrum. Light from both objects will  
appear to have the same blue shift when observed from the other. If objects  
are moving away from each other, light shifts toward the red end of the  
spectrum.

Dear non dual and others,   
Today's menu is: Mor-kuzhambu. This is hot hot butter milk/   
chilly gravy.   
Take descicated coconut, green chillies, soaked toor dhal   
and jeera and make a paste in the mixer. Take good butter   
milk, not very alkaline, in a vessel and heat it till boils. After   
boiling butter milk is ready, add jack fruit nuts, cut pieces   
of either bendi or ash gourd and heat it again. Check whether   
the vegetable is soft. Then, pour the mixed paste mentioned   
above and stir it the compound nicely for a while. The resultant   
gravy is Mor-kuzhambu. Add curry leaves for taste. No masala   
because the green chilly paste is there.   
This is prepared on a few days in Sri Ramansramam.   
This can be taken with rice only. A separate currey may be   
necessary as a side dish.   
Arunachala Siva.

boiling butter milk is ready, add jack fruit nuts, cut pieces   
of either bendi or ash gourd and heat it again. Check whether   
the vegetable is soft. Then, pour the mixed paste mentioned   
above and stir it the compound nicely for a while. The resultant   
gravy is Mor-kuzhambu. Add curry leaves for taste. No masala   
because the green chilly paste is there.   
This is prepared on a few days in Sri Ramansramam.   
This can be taken with rice only. A separate currey may be   
necessary as a side dish.   
Arunachala Siva.

On realization, you feel complete, fulfilled, free from the pleasure-pain

can put it only in negative terms: "Nothing is wrong with me any longer". It  
is only by comparison with the past that you know that you are out of it.

can, it is not the real thing. Be silent and watch it expressing itself in

Dear Mark, Wonderful! Yes, the experience can never be reduced   
into words. Lao Tse has said: Those who speak, know not; Those   
who know speak not. In Tamil, they say: 'Kandavar Vindilar;   
Vindavar Kandilar', meaning, those who have seen, cannot express;   
those who express have not seen.'   
Again, one Tamil Saiva Saint, called Thayumanavar, who lived in   
17th century has said a beautiful example. In the morning after   
the nuptial night, the bride comes out of the room and she is   
unable to express anything to any one. Even to her mother, she   
is not able to say anything and she merely, 'looks' at her mother!

"i" am 51 years old and have had two western "teachers". These teachers  
honored all the "Wisdom" teachings as do i. i have photos of the most recent  
Indian gurus,saints on my home altar. Though the photo of Ramana stuns this  
consciousness into that silent stillness as do his sayings put forth by David  
Godman, etc. & in "Thus Spake Ramana Maharshi". i consider "my" body a tube of  
flesh seemingly used by consciousness for reasons personally unknown, although  
Ramana, Nisargadatta,& Meher Baba give thorough explanations as to this  
seeming "play" of consciousness. i also see no difference between jnana or  
bhakti since both respected Yogas have helped this personal self in it's  
emptying and erasure. This said, i feel a present urge to stay at or near  
Aranachala for an extended period of time if not even possibly the rest of  
this dream life as did Ramana. i am not trying to escape an unpleasant life as  
i have always seemed to live a grace filled existence, mostly because of  
seeing solutions rather than problems and of course surrender in the personal  
sense has been key to a less ego filled life and therefore less suffering. i  
live in a small simple rental on a beautiful 5 acre fruit farm away from any  
city on the island of Maui in Hawaii and earn an average income. i would have  
to save some capital in order to stay an extended period, although i would be  
able to get there if there were possibilities of staying for seva. i am in  
exellent physical health and have always been called on first for seva since  
cooking and cleaning and any seva has always come natural to this "i".Please i  
would sweetly welcome any input or advice. Thank You, Namaste, knowone

You can definitely stay in Tiruvannamalai, for a lifetime, if Ramana   
Wills. As an initial one time expenditure, you may have to buy a   
small apartment, in Tiruvannamalai (You cannot stay for ever inside   
the Ashram), for Rs 0.50 million (approx. US$ 12000.00).   
2\. You may have to get acclimitized to the tropic weather -   
ranging between 35 to 45 degrees celsius.   
3\. You may have to get used to tropical South Indian rice food, hot   
but tasty and water which is not sensitized.   
3\. Clothing is your choice, but Indian cotton clothes are the best   
suited, no suits, overcoats, woolen sweaters and shoes.   
All these will happen to you, if there is Ramana's Will. In fact,   
I saw recently many many "foreigners" who are thoroughly   
enjoying the stay in that divine place. The touring westerners and   
staying westerners are increasing in numbers every day.   
Arunachala Siva.

To Arunachala Siva,   
 Thank you for your timely response! As i live on a tropical island i am a little acclimated to humid weather though not quite as humid as my many friends who have traveled to and lived in India have mentioned. As to hot or even Indian food i have enjoyed both for almost four decades.Concerning purchasing an apartment or some type of residence there do you personally know of any or know someone who does. i did contact Indiaproperty.com and got on there list, i believe i found them on a site about Arunachala. Also i was recently told of the Indian government confiscating property of foreign nationals? Do you know anything about that? i have in-joyed reading your other posts. When i do come to Arunachala, Ramana willing, it would be so nice to meet such knowledgeable persons as yourself. Thank You again, knowone

Dear knowone, as far as I know there is no Indian law, confiscating   
property bought by foreigners, but there is a need to get prior   
approval for any non-resident Indian to buy property in India. This   
is not difficult for any genuine NRI buyer. But, since Tiruvannamalai   
is attracting western seekers in large numbers, the property in   
Tiruvannamalai is sought after very much. This has given rise to a   
good number of unreliable agents who dupe the foreign nationals.   
Hence, one has to be very careful. Please seek the advices of   
Ramansramam, who can guide you, not through this Forum, but   
through their separate e mail address: ashram@ramana-maharshi.org.   
With best wishes, Arunachala Siva.

Hi!   
First off: I'm sorry that I'm replying to such an old topic, and by the  
following NO OFFENCE IS INTENDED AT ALL, I'm just trying to clarify, for  
myself, Ramana's teachings. Ramana Maharshi is the being i respect the most.   
Why wouldn't it be Ramana's will? And isn't it in 'conflict' (in lack of a  
better word) with Ramana simple, beautiful and direct teachings, to  
concentrate on matters not concerned with attaining liberation, such as  
believing that he have a will after his physical death, and that, if he had,  
that it would change future events? Or believing the opposite, that it isn't  
possible, as well?   
Again, this is not a criticism. I have only read "Who am I?", but I'm planing  
to print his collected works from sriramanamaharshi.org and to read it.   
May all have 'luck' in their path towards liberation!

Dear knowone,   
Why do you want to go to Arunachala ? Why dont you practise at your own place.  
In truth, there is really no place where Ramana is not there.   
If you are sincere and a devotee... you should rather spend time on prayer or  
Practise rather than changing your place of stay.   
Changing your place of stay wont change you the person. .. change the  
person... so that you can see Ramana's presence here and now - where ever you  
are.   
So, observe your thoughts and feelings and become independent of them, soon.   
Practise the rememberance of yourself as Self and get liberated. The Self is  
Ramana... it is nearer to you than anything else. Even your body is farther  
from you than Ramana.   
What a futile exercise it would be to try to go to an alien land and buy a  
house there, stay there etc. Stay where you are... and find Ramana there  
itself. .. he is there as much as here.   
This is my advice.   
Love!   
Silence

I saw on previous posts email address for enquiries on accomodation at the  
Ashram - Thanks.   
Is there any teaching or guidance available in the Ashram in case required?   
(I encounter some difficulties in my current practice).   
As far as I remember this the start of the monsoon season in Tami Nadu, from

Dear Billbill,   
I am glad you are visiting Sri Ramansramam, in a week's time.   
A few tips, since I have gone there, in the beginning of this week.   
1\. Stay is possible in Asram's guest houses, (inside and outside   
Asram) only with prior written request and their written permission.   
Further, no one can stay beyond three days in guest houses. For   
a longer stay, you choose a hotel, (there are many with different   
levels of comforts), the charges will be around Rs 400 per day   
for a double room. Only vegetarian food will be available on   
extra payment.   
2\. There is no rain in T. Malai right now. The temperature is around   
35 degrees celsius.   
3\. Regarding self enquriy practices:- People are quite busy in   
Asram. You may have to patiently request them and wait for their   
convenience. You may also ask fellow pilgrims.   
4\. You can eat inside the Asram. Their timings are:-   
7.00 am - Coffee/tea   
11.30 am - lunch   
4.00 pm \- tea   
7.30 pm \- dinner   
Arunachala Siva.

A while back I posted about the faith I felt upon reading a Ramana quote.  
Upon reading Graham's post "Tolerance" there seemed to be some kind of  
objection about the properness of this topic on a nonduality forum. But  
nothing was posted for discussion. It seemsto me that words and their meanings  
can be a continual source of disagreement of what they mean to one and to  
what they mean to another. It seems to me that is enivtable. but words are all  
we have when in discussion, and that why we are here to be vigilant. So I  
will offer more words on what I meant with the word "faith".   
Today I found this quote from Nisargadatta today that speaks mt intent much  
more eloquently than I did or could. So offer this to the the forum, a quote  
from Nisargadatta: The witness attitude is also faith; it is faith in oneself. You believe that  
you are not what you experience, and you look at everything as from a  
distance. There is no effort in witnessing. You understand that you are the  
witness only, and the understanding acts. You need nothing more, just remember  
that you are the witness only. If in the state of witnessing you ask yourself  
'Who am I?', the answer comes at once, though it is wordless and silent. Cease  
to be the object and become the subject of all that happens; once having  
turned within, you will find yourself beyond the subject. When you have found  
yourself, you will find that you are also beyond the object, that both the  
subject and the object exist in you, but you are neither.   
Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj   
Thanks Nissie, you speak my heart so well.   
With love,   
Mark

Hi Mark,   
Re: the item on tolerance   
This relates to private mail sent to me querying the validity of the subject

The writer did not make the complaint public out of respect, but I thought it

I consider Ramana Maharishi as a natural Vipassi. In Vipassana one has to  
meditate and meditate continously then one gets enlightenment. But in his case  
may be over lifetimes after lifetimes in his past lives he might have  
spiritually so evovled that in his this life he had to just sit for half an  
hour and he just attained it. I am a great admirer of his soul, how kind and  
humane his soul was.

Could be he was already enlightened and his love for all beings brought him  
here.   
Like the way he allowed himself to physically travel help Gnapati Sastri  
[page 96 Ramana Maharishi and the path of self knowledge by Arthur Osbourne]   
He didnt say to himself I will use occult powers to travel to help Sastrri, he  
just let himself be transported there because there was a need.   
This I believe is the clue to his incarnation.   
 He was ALREADY ENLIGHTENED,   
 He simply allowed the incarnation as Venkataraman. He allowed the ego to form  
and the young man to reach a certian age, whilst the brain and mind were  
programmed.   
When this was done that Great Soul took over and the incarnation as Ramana  
began.   
If we look at his whole life it followed this pattern,   
He never sought to be a Guru yet being one just happened without him making a  
conscoius effort to be one.   
He never sought fame, and yet fame just happened.   
So I reckon thats how he came into the world!!   
He was drawn here because there was/is a need for him. Not of his own  
volition, but out of his all abding love!!

I wonder about reincarnation. If everything is one consciousness, what is it  
that reincarnates? The memory does not move onto the next life, and the  
individual as a separate entity seems to be a mental construct. To me,  
reincarnation does not seem to be a useful idea. Anyone else have an opinion,  
for or against?

What makes you say that the memory doesnt pass to the next life?   
They are there hidden beyond the ego.   
Its difficult to remmember what one did last month or 10 years ago!! This  
doesnt mean that the memoreis arent there, it just means that they are not  
readily accessible.   
Its seems that the identification "I am the body" prevents them being found.   
It seems that in each lifetime we believe that we are this particular person  
,this body, these thoughts.   
Ramana said that becoming enlightened was "Like waking from a dream of  
wandering all over the world"   
As to the all one consciousness thing, well maybe the raindrop still stays  
itself even when it disolves into the ocean.

memories are a function of the brain, when it dies those memories die also.   
what we think is the self is a thought, a story the brain tells, and it also  
will die when the brain dies so there is really no self to reincarnate.   
reincarnation is not personal but only seems to be when viewed from a personal  
perspective.   
as for enlightenment. .. ramana was already enlightened, yes, just as we all  
are. to see this, just as ramana did, we have only to stop believing that  
we are not.

If memories were merely a function of the brain, then how could anyone recall  
past lives?   
Reincarnation is the most personal thing that happens to us. Each time we  
identify with the new body and suffer all its pains, know its loves. die its  
deaths, fight its wars. Buddha said Verily you have shed more blood than are  
in the oceans.   
Reincarnation is the single biggest incentive to try hard at meditation. Cos  
if you dont make it this time then yooos is coming back for another dose  
.Could be in a war zone, or with a horrible disease, or any of the awful  
things that happen to us when we fall into Samasara   
Maybe the brain is the organ of the retrival of memory but it is plainly not  
the storehouse.   
Ramana said becoming enlightened was like a dream of wandering all over the  
world.   
The dream being all the previous lives, which he knew were only like dreams.   
He also said, As everything that happens happens only to the Ego, then nothing  
ever happens.   
Look at the page 193. Chapter 18. Reincarnation. Of Be As You Are THE  
TEACHINGS OF SRI RAMANA MAHARISHI, by David Godman.   
Here you will find Ramanas teaching on reincarnation.   
Also you might investigate the Yogic idea of Akashic Cliches, which explain  
transpersonal memories.

I got this idea from repeatedly reading instructions to Sivarakasam Pillai.   
Why are things the way they are?   
If all that exists is ONE,   
If you divide ONE you get TWO,   
Divide again FOUR   
And again EIGHT.   
And so on.   
So this means that numbers and mathematics were NOT CREATED!!   
They are just a simple fact of the nature of reality!   
From this we might deduce that all of matter and the very existence of the  
Universe and all its laws are the same.   
No matter many universes there might be, no matter how many sub-atomic  
particles are found, they are ALL are result of the division of ONE. And the  
ONE is ALL!   
So all that exists is the nature of REALITY, uncreated, eternal unchanging and  
unchangeable!!

ALSO   
Another concept which seems to explain existence.   
What would exixts if nithing at all existed?   
No stars no planets.   
No matter.   
No space.   
No time.   
A VOID, in which there was nothing.   
Well the VOID would still exist!!   
Therefore EXISTENCE IS!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
I mean what would there be if there was non exixtence?   
There is no such thing as non being!   
One cannot even concieve of non exixstence.   
I dont mean the non existence of the material Universes ~~.   
............................................................   
And as consciousness is known to be.   
Then consciuosness is what IS!!   
Nothing could exist if there was not anything to be consciuos of it!   
Only consciuosness exists!~~

If the previous two posts are true.   
Then.   
All that happens,

All [whether real or not] Universes and beings living within the Universes.

1;All over the world people fight and kill each other for conflicting  
ideologies.   
Crazy ideas about the nature of God and the nature of reality.   
2;The computer with which we comunicate and the science tha created it are  
part of the investigation into the nature of physical reality.   
Surley it must be right to have concepts on the mental plane which get as near  
as is possible to the truth, rather than some of the ideas which are around  
,which are close to complete madness.   
The constant refining and updating of the mental and verbal ideas to get them  
closer to the Ultimate Truth must surely be a good thing? And might help  
others who follow the path. Isnt this just what all books on this subject do?

Books after all are views....ideologies are mine, yours and theirs...Baghvan  
was many times asked/ hinted why He is so quite when all of India was burning.  
His answer was always the same...improve our own attitude.   
Research into Religion, nature of God, heaven and hell has not made us any  
better. As on Dec 2006, the scientist are trying to solve BIG BANG. Concept  
is a thought. Imagine the whole world in deep sleep...then during that  
sleep....there is no world...a concept isn't it. So very temporary.   
I am who I am... all the refining and updating on mental plane leaves me  
stranded. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni was a refined man...well versed in all that  
books had to offer, yet he knew something was not right. And he got his  
answer.   
I can help a blind person to cross the road.... I surely cannot help if he  
blames the whole world for his darkness.   
I have to change my attitude...I have to unlearn and start all over  
again....and for this I need lot of LOVE and Faith... Bhakti...Devotion...

captmj   
I suggest you have a look at David Godmans book "Be as you are"   
You wil see that Ramana always answered sincere questions intelligently and  
lucidly.   
And he used metaphors from the modern world!! For instance his likening of the  
percieved world to the picture on a movie screen and saying that it is like  
the audience AND the actors being on the screen simultaneously !! Look at his  
replies to al the questions about the nature of things.   
You yourself are using thought to comunicate and are constantly forming  
concepts as you relate to material life.   
Everything has its place and what might loosely be called purpose.Without the  
process of conceptualisation you wouldnt know anything at all !!   
If you look at the world around you its possible to see, in a quite practical  
way that it is a picture WITHIN you. As Ramana said there is no inside and  
outside for the self. Certain psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD cause  
perception of the world to be distorted, making it plain that what we percieve  
to be the world is no more than a picture within us ! My one experience of  
Nirvikapala Samadhi and the Kundalini was in 1971 on LSD.   
So these statements that the world isnt real are actualy true!! In the sense  
that what we percieve as the world is, I qoute Ramana, "cordinated sense  
impressions",   
The picture of the world is created from cordinated sense impressions. The  
qualities that we experience, pleasant, bad, good, nice nasty, these are all  
the mind. Astral energy made from Sat Chit Ananda. The division [apparent ] of  
the Self into Duality gives rise to the mind and all its machinations. So I  
observe this within, in daily life. I recognise the process of mind as much as  
I am able.   
The mind is nescessary otherwise no forward progress is possible.   
Improve your attitude ? Knowing the truth at all levels possible IS improving  
your attitude!   
Peace   
Mick!!!

. ..Hello Mick   
There is no conflict...only varied interpretation. It used to happen right in  
front of Baghavan.   
Did I reject concepts...I dont think so. I am attempting to separate the ego I  
from the concepts...Yes I agree the world will be as long as there is  
impressions and concepts. Statements that world is untrue are statements...  
when the untruth is preceived, no statement will be necessary.   
To me Baghvan is silence...   
As Ramana says..mind turned inwards is pure and pure mind is Atma or truth  
...whatever the name is...   
And only by improving the attitude will lead me to truth at all levels or for  
that matter beyond levels..turiyattita.   
Till that time I need mind to improve my mind, material mind has to unlearn  
and turn within.   
Yours In Baghvan

Thats right. its what I meant.   
Varied interpretation, different interpretations suit different personalities.  
It must be a good thing if things can be seen to make sense!   
For me Ramana was/is the greatest guru of all time.   
Silence is hard to achieve.   
I get it that the I thought isnt the self, that if the I thought is a thought  
then there would seem to have to be an experiencer of the I thought. Also that  
this experiencer isnt real, it doesent exist. I sort of get it. I guess thats  
the limit of where the mind can go!   
But I do try!!

No Mick. ...havent seen the film...will when i get the chance.   
I am almost on a flight to Lagos and waiting at the lounge with Nan Yar in my  
pocket....well you started the thread and it was good. So here I am checking  
out what you had to say next...I am reading question 21 of the dialogue..   
Sivaprakasam Pillai : Is enquiry into scriptural teaching necessary for an  
earnest seeker ?   
Bagahvan : As there is no use in analysing the garbage collected, so it is  
with an earnest seeker who is searching for his-self,.There is no use for a  
person who wants to understand his -self, instead of discarding the ignorance  
that hides his- self, does research on his-self. This prapancham...crudely  
translated in English as "world " . .. ( for want of better description)  
should be perceived as a dream...   
Now then is it necessary for us to analyse nature of reality   
Swami Dayananda in his commentary on Upadesa Saram says...thoughts are of 2  
types. ..mechanical and purposeful....   
mechanical thoughts are destructive. ...so lets avoid mechanical thoughts....a  
mind over which there is no control is a monkey...   
In Baghvan

captmj   
The post is ABOUT holding onto the perception of the world as a dream!!   
By realising that perception off the world is a picture manufactured by the  
mind out of cosciuossness.   
Thats why I started the post.   
I say to myself that is isnt real, that what Im seeing is an illusion. that  
the experiences that Ive had show me this.   
Otherwise I forget and start taking the ups and downs of material life  
seriously!!!   
And if I can get it into a more concise verbal form , or use a more modern  
metaphor it makes conversation with anyone else who is interested easier!!!!   
I talk for a living!!   
Peace, love and understanding   
Mick!!!

silence is hard to achieve. ... mick   
the truth is it takes energy to think thoughts, and silence requires no  
energy at all.   
if what you want is truth, you will not find it in reason. following  
thoughts leads away from truth.

beloved abstract   
Tell me did you think when you repllied to the post?   
How can there be a discusion forum without thoughts?   
Silence takes no enegy for Who?   
Strange how people here, instead of discusng the topic give wise advice. I  
wonder what is the cause of this?   
Be careful that you do not make a dogma out of what should be an honest quest  
.That is the way of religion, and look at all the trouble that causes!   
Peace!

AND   
Please correct me if Im wrong, but It seems to me that silence takes many  
,many lifetimes of effort and even with that effort it needs some grace too.   
Stetching around you the infinite Universe, living beings, seemingly without  
end and not many of them are Silent.   
Nor on this little planet, very very few have there ever ever been such as  
Ramana Mahirishi! Silence no effort for this great and compassionate being  
,but for a lowly being such as I its a big effort!!!!!!!

when you realize that who you think you are is only a story, everything falls

as long as you are searching for something, you are overlooking the truth

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

ALSO   
I notice that when someone went to Ramana with a philosohical question, like"  
why would God will this way? " Ramana ANSWERS THE QUESTION!!!. He doesnt make  
comments about the questioners LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT. Ramana  
does his best to answer the question.   
He doesnt see himself as some superior being looking down on the questioner.   
This is the real thing !!!!100% enlighened being, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   
No trying to get followers.   
No feeling of superiority.

This does not make any sense to me at all. Numbers are a concept of the human

thoughts... _reALity_ even, without consciousness?   
Consciousness is the source of all...everything, infinity including

.The human mind itself exists as a result of the divisoin of ONE. All that  
exists is ONE. Existence itself cannot be dual. For this reason all that  
exists is the result of divsion!   
The SELF is SAT CHIT ANANDA. Divide it you get the Duality of subject and  
object. You get the Ego which percieves the Object [not really real though]  
and you get the objects percieved. The percieved qualities of the object the  
,ASTRAL aspect, result from the ANANDA aspect of the SELF.   
The EGO or imaginary "I", results from the Chit aspect of the SELF. When the  
duality ceases in SAMADHI The SELF is revealed as being only ONE.   
Everything fits together, everything is logical, everything makes sense.   
And ALL that exists is CONSCIUOSNESS   
And CONSCIUOSNESS is only ONE!

Everything he did.   
Every word he spoke.   
All examples of what we could/are/be.

What requirement does is'ness have for the words "ALL" and "ONE" except for  
the processing of thoughts which simply binds oneself from recognising the  
thought's source, that which IS...   
Perhaps one should focus their attention on the meaning of ALL aswell as  
ONENESS. ALL is infinity, this is why i asked earlier, _how can you divide  
infinity?_ All divisions are created by mathmatical concepts of the mind.

That which lies beyond the Primal Cause can only be experienced and not  
defined by words, call it division or whatever you like, these words are  
calculated and formed within the mind.

Originally there was Void. (Before void, what was there? We   
do not know. Some play like the one, which I am describing was   
there ). Then the Brahman or God or Shiva breathed out.   
Came the universe. When the play is over, the Brahman or God   
or Shiva, would breath in and everything will go away leaving   
Void. Buddha said there is only Void, Mahasunya. Shankara said,   
it is Sat-Chit-Ananda, the Existence-Knowledge-Bliss. Bhagavan has   
said that after the play is over, only the Screen remains. Screen is   
there, before, during and after the play. Saiva Siddhantists call it: Siva-Oli and Parai-Natham - the Effulgence of Shiva and Sound of   
the anklets of dancing Kali.

I got this idea from repeatedly reading instructions to Sivarakasam Pillai.   
Why are things the way they are?   
If all that exists is ONE,   
If you divide ONE you get TWO,   
Divide again FOUR   
And again EIGHT.   
And so on.   
So this means that numbers and mathematics were NOT CREATED!!   
They are just a simple fact of the nature of reality!   
From this we might deduce that all of matter and the very existence of the  
Universe and all its laws are the same.   
No matter many universes there might be, no matter how many sub-atomic  
particles are found, they are ALL are result of the division of ONE. And the  
ONE is ALL!   
So all that exists is the nature of REALITY, uncreated, eternal unchanging and  
unchangeable!!

Books after all are views....ideologies are mine, yours and theirs...Baghvan  
was many times asked/ hinted why He is so quite when all of India was burning.  
His answer was always the same...improve our own attitude.   
Research into Religion, nature of God, heaven and hell has not made us any  
better. As on Dec 2006, the scientist are trying to solve BIG BANG. Concept  
is a thought. Imagine the whole world in deep sleep...then during that  
sleep....there is no world...a concept isn't it. So very temporary.   
I am who I am... all the refining and updating on mental plane leaves me  
stranded. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni was a refined man...well versed in all that  
books had to offer, yet he knew something was not right. And he got his  
answer.   
I can help a blind person to cross the road.... I surely cannot help if he  
blames the whole world for his darkness.   
I have to change my attitude...I have to unlearn and start all over

I suggest you have a look at David Godmans book "Be as you are"   
You wil see that Ramana always answered sincere questions intelligently and  
lucidly.   
And he used metaphors from the modern world!! For instance his likening of the  
percieved world to the picture on a movie screen and saying that it is like  
the audience AND the actors being on the screen simultaneously !! Look at his  
replies to al the questions about the nature of things.   
You yourself are using thought to comunicate and are constantly forming  
concepts as you relate to material life.   
Everything has its place and what might loosely be called purpose.Without the  
process of conceptualisation you wouldnt know anything at all !!   
If you look at the world around you its possible to see, in a quite practical  
way that it is a picture WITHIN you. As Ramana said there is no inside and  
outside for the self. Certain psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD cause  
perception of the world to be distorted, making it plain that what we percieve  
to be the world is no more than a picture within us ! My one experience of  
Nirvikapala Samadhi and the Kundalini was in 1971 on LSD.   
So these statements that the world isnt real are actualy true!! In the sense  
that what we percieve as the world is, I qoute Ramana, "cordinated sense  
impressions",   
The picture of the world is created from cordinated sense impressions. The  
qualities that we experience, pleasant, bad, good, nice nasty, these are all  
the mind. Astral energy made from Sat Chit Ananda. The division [apparent ] of  
the Self into Duality gives rise to the mind and all its machinations. So I  
observe this within, in daily life. I recognise the process of mind as much as  
I am able.   
The mind is nescessary otherwise no forward progress is possible.   
Improve your attitude ? Knowing the truth at all levels possible IS improving  
your attitude!   
Peace   
Mick!!!

. ..Hello Mick   
There is no conflict...only varied interpretation. It used to happen right in  
front of Baghavan.   
Did I reject concepts...I dont think so. I am attempting to separate the ego I  
from the concepts...Yes I agree the world will be as long as there is  
impressions and concepts. Statements that world is untrue are statements...  
when the untruth is preceived, no statement will be necessary.   
To me Baghvan is silence...   
As Ramana says..mind turned inwards is pure and pure mind is Atma or truth  
...whatever the name is...   
And only by improving the attitude will lead me to truth at all levels or for  
that matter beyond levels..turiyattita.   
Till that time I need mind to improve my mind, material mind has to unlearn  
and turn within.   
Yours In Baghvan

Thats right. its what I meant.   
Varied interpretation, different interpretations suit different personalities.  
It must be a good thing if things can be seen to make sense!   
For me Ramana was/is the greatest guru of all time.   
Silence is hard to achieve.   
I get it that the I thought isnt the self, that if the I thought is a thought  
then there would seem to have to be an experiencer of the I thought. Also that  
this experiencer isnt real, it doesent exist. I sort of get it. I guess thats  
the limit of where the mind can go!   
But I do try!!

No Mick. ...havent seen the film...will when i get the chance.   
I am almost on a flight to Lagos and waiting at the lounge with Nan Yar in my  
pocket....well you started the thread and it was good. So here I am checking  
out what you had to say next...I am reading question 21 of the dialogue..   
Sivaprakasam Pillai : Is enquiry into scriptural teaching necessary for an  
earnest seeker ?   
Bagahvan : As there is no use in analysing the garbage collected, so it is  
with an earnest seeker who is searching for his-self,.There is no use for a  
person who wants to understand his -self, instead of discarding the ignorance  
that hides his- self, does research on his-self. This prapancham...crudely  
translated in English as "world " . .. ( for want of better description)  
should be perceived as a dream...   
Now then is it necessary for us to analyse nature of reality   
Swami Dayananda in his commentary on Upadesa Saram says...thoughts are of 2  
types. ..mechanical and purposeful....   
mechanical thoughts are destructive. ...so lets avoid mechanical thoughts....a  
mind over which there is no control is a monkey...   
In Baghvan

The post is ABOUT holding onto the perception of the world as a dream!!   
By realising that perception off the world is a picture manufactured by the  
mind out of cosciuossness.   
Thats why I started the post.   
I say to myself that is isnt real, that what Im seeing is an illusion. that  
the experiences that Ive had show me this.   
Otherwise I forget and start taking the ups and downs of material life  
seriously!!!   
And if I can get it into a more concise verbal form , or use a more modern  
metaphor it makes conversation with anyone else who is interested easier!!!!   
I talk for a living!!

the truth is it takes energy to think thoughts, and silence requires no

if what you want is truth, you will not find it in reason. following

Tell me did you think when you repllied to the post?   
How can there be a discusion forum without thoughts?   
Silence takes no enegy for Who?   
Strange how people here, instead of discusng the topic give wise advice. I  
wonder what is the cause of this?   
Be careful that you do not make a dogma out of what should be an honest quest  
.That is the way of religion, and look at all the trouble that causes!

AND   
Please correct me if Im wrong, but It seems to me that silence takes many  
,many lifetimes of effort and even with that effort it needs some grace too.   
Stetching around you the infinite Universe, living beings, seemingly without  
end and not many of them are Silent.   
Nor on this little planet, very very few have there ever ever been such as  
Ramana Mahirishi! Silence no effort for this great and compassionate being  
,but for a lowly being such as I its a big effort!!!!!!!

I got this idea from repeatedly reading instructions to Sivarakasam Pillai.   
Why are things the way they are?   
If all that exists is ONE,   
If you divide ONE you get TWO,   
Divide again FOUR   
And again EIGHT.   
And so on.   
So this means that numbers and mathematics were NOT CREATED!!   
They are just a simple fact of the nature of reality!   
From this we might deduce that all of matter and the very existence of the  
Universe and all its laws are the same.   
No matter many universes there might be, no matter how many sub-atomic  
particles are found, they are ALL are result of the division of ONE. And the  
ONE is ALL!   
So all that exists is the nature of REALITY, uncreated, eternal unchanging and

concepts as you relate to material life.   
Everything has its place and what might loosely be called purpose.Without the  
process of conceptualisation you wouldnt know anything at all !!   
If you look at the world around you its possible to see, in a quite practical  
way that it is a picture WITHIN you. As Ramana said there is no inside and  
outside for the self. Certain psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD cause  
perception of the world to be distorted, making it plain that what we percieve  
to be the world is no more than a picture within us ! My one experience of  
Nirvikapala Samadhi and the Kundalini was in 1971 on LSD.   
So these statements that the world isnt real are actualy true!! In the sense  
that what we percieve as the world is, I qoute Ramana, "cordinated sense  
impressions",   
The picture of the world is created from cordinated sense impressions. The  
qualities that we experience, pleasant, bad, good, nice nasty, these are all  
the mind. Astral energy made from Sat Chit Ananda. The division [apparent ] of  
the Self into Duality gives rise to the mind and all its machinations. So I  
observe this within, in daily life. I recognise the process of mind as much as  
I am able.   
The mind is nescessary otherwise no forward progress is possible.   
Improve your attitude ? Knowing the truth at all levels possible IS improving  
your attitude!   
Peace   
Mick!!!

. ..Hello Mick   
There is no conflict...only varied interpretation. It used to happen right in  
front of Baghavan.   
Did I reject concepts...I dont think so. I am attempting to separate the ego I  
from the concepts...Yes I agree the world will be as long as there is  
impressions and concepts. Statements that world is untrue are statements...  
when the untruth is preceived, no statement will be necessary.   
To me Baghvan is silence...   
As Ramana says..mind turned inwards is pure and pure mind is Atma or truth  
...whatever the name is...   
And only by improving the attitude will lead me to truth at all levels or for  
that matter beyond levels..turiyattita.   
Till that time I need mind to improve my mind, material mind has to unlearn  
and turn within.   
Yours In Baghvan

Thats right. its what I meant.   
Varied interpretation, different interpretations suit different personalities.  
It must be a good thing if things can be seen to make sense!   
For me Ramana was/is the greatest guru of all time.   
Silence is hard to achieve.   
I get it that the I thought isnt the self, that if the I thought is a thought  
then there would seem to have to be an experiencer of the I thought. Also that  
this experiencer isnt real, it doesent exist. I sort of get it. I guess thats

No Mick. ...havent seen the film...will when i get the chance.   
I am almost on a flight to Lagos and waiting at the lounge with Nan Yar in my  
pocket....well you started the thread and it was good. So here I am checking  
out what you had to say next...I am reading question 21 of the dialogue..   
Sivaprakasam Pillai : Is enquiry into scriptural teaching necessary for an  
earnest seeker ?   
Bagahvan : As there is no use in analysing the garbage collected, so it is  
with an earnest seeker who is searching for his-self,.There is no use for a  
person who wants to understand his -self, instead of discarding the ignorance  
that hides his- self, does research on his-self. This prapancham...crudely  
translated in English as "world " . .. ( for want of better description)  
should be perceived as a dream...   
Now then is it necessary for us to analyse nature of reality   
Swami Dayananda in his commentary on Upadesa Saram says...thoughts are of 2  
types. ..mechanical and purposeful....   
mechanical thoughts are destructive. ...so lets avoid mechanical thoughts....a  
mind over which there is no control is a monkey...

The post is ABOUT holding onto the perception of the world as a dream!!   
By realising that perception off the world is a picture manufactured by the  
mind out of cosciuossness.   
Thats why I started the post.   
I say to myself that is isnt real, that what Im seeing is an illusion. that  
the experiences that Ive had show me this.   
Otherwise I forget and start taking the ups and downs of material life  
seriously!!!   
And if I can get it into a more concise verbal form , or use a more modern  
metaphor it makes conversation with anyone else who is interested easier!!!!   
I talk for a living!!   
Peace, love and understanding

silence is hard to achieve. ... mick   
the truth is it takes energy to think thoughts, and silence requires no  
energy at all.   
if what you want is truth, you will not find it in reason. following  
thoughts leads away from truth.

Tell me did you think when you repllied to the post?   
How can there be a discusion forum without thoughts?   
Silence takes no enegy for Who?   
Strange how people here, instead of discusng the topic give wise advice. I  
wonder what is the cause of this?   
Be careful that you do not make a dogma out of what should be an honest quest  
.That is the way of religion, and look at all the trouble that causes!

AND   
Please correct me if Im wrong, but It seems to me that silence takes many  
,many lifetimes of effort and even with that effort it needs some grace too.   
Stetching around you the infinite Universe, living beings, seemingly without  
end and not many of them are Silent.   
Nor on this little planet, very very few have there ever ever been such as  
Ramana Mahirishi! Silence no effort for this great and compassionate being  
,but for a lowly being such as I its a big effort!!!!!!!

I got this idea from repeatedly reading instructions to Sivarakasam Pillai.   
Why are things the way they are?   
If all that exists is ONE,   
If you divide ONE you get TWO,   
Divide again FOUR   
And again EIGHT.   
And so on.   
So this means that numbers and mathematics were NOT CREATED!!   
They are just a simple fact of the nature of reality!   
From this we might deduce that all of matter and the very existence of the  
Universe and all its laws are the same.   
No matter many universes there might be, no matter how many sub-atomic  
particles are found, they are ALL are result of the division of ONE. And the  
ONE is ALL!   
So all that exists is the nature of REALITY, uncreated, eternal unchanging and  
unchangeable!!

ALSO   
Another concept which seems to explain existence.   
What would exixts if nithing at all existed?   
No stars no planets.   
No matter.   
No space.   
No time.   
A VOID, in which there was nothing.   
Well the VOID would still exist!!   
Therefore EXISTENCE IS!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
I mean what would there be if there was non exixtence?   
There is no such thing as non being!   
One cannot even concieve of non exixstence.   
I dont mean the non existence of the material Universes ~~.   
............................................................   
And as consciousness is known to be.   
Then consciuosness is what IS!!   
Nothing could exist if there was not anything to be consciuos of it!   
Only consciuosness exists!~~

So   
If the previous two posts are true.   
Then.   
All that happens,   
All percieved events.   
All [whether real or not] Universes and beings living within the Universes.   
All these exist as a consequence of the Nature of reality.

1;All over the world people fight and kill each other for conflicting  
ideologies.   
Crazy ideas about the nature of God and the nature of reality.   
2;The computer with which we comunicate and the science tha created it are  
part of the investigation into the nature of physical reality.   
Surley it must be right to have concepts on the mental plane which get as near  
as is possible to the truth, rather than some of the ideas which are around  
,which are close to complete madness.   
The constant refining and updating of the mental and verbal ideas to get them  
closer to the Ultimate Truth must surely be a good thing? And might help  
others who follow the path. Isnt this just what all books on this subject do?   
Peace!!!

Books after all are views....ideologies are mine, yours and theirs...Baghvan  
was many times asked/ hinted why He is so quite when all of India was burning.  
His answer was always the same...improve our own attitude.   
Research into Religion, nature of God, heaven and hell has not made us any  
better. As on Dec 2006, the scientist are trying to solve BIG BANG. Concept  
is a thought. Imagine the whole world in deep sleep...then during that  
sleep....there is no world...a concept isn't it. So very temporary.   
I am who I am... all the refining and updating on mental plane leaves me  
stranded. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni was a refined man...well versed in all that  
books had to offer, yet he knew something was not right. And he got his  
answer.   
I can help a blind person to cross the road.... I surely cannot help if he  
blames the whole world for his darkness.   
I have to change my attitude...I have to unlearn and start all over  
again....and for this I need lot of LOVE and Faith... Bhakti...Devotion...

I suggest you have a look at David Godmans book "Be as you are"   
You wil see that Ramana always answered sincere questions intelligently and  
lucidly.   
And he used metaphors from the modern world!! For instance his likening of the  
percieved world to the picture on a movie screen and saying that it is like  
the audience AND the actors being on the screen simultaneously !! Look at his  
replies to al the questions about the nature of things.   
You yourself are using thought to comunicate and are constantly forming  
concepts as you relate to material life.   
Everything has its place and what might loosely be called purpose.Without the

And if I can get it into a more concise verbal form , or use a more modern  
metaphor it makes conversation with anyone else who is interested easier!!!!   
I talk for a living!!   
Peace, love and understanding   
Mick!!!

silence is hard to achieve. ... mick   
the truth is it takes energy to think thoughts, and silence requires no  
energy at all.   
if what you want is truth, you will not find it in reason. following  
thoughts leads away from truth.

beloved abstract   
Tell me did you think when you repllied to the post?   
How can there be a discusion forum without thoughts?   
Silence takes no enegy for Who?   
Strange how people here, instead of discusng the topic give wise advice. I  
wonder what is the cause of this?   
Be careful that you do not make a dogma out of what should be an honest quest  
.That is the way of religion, and look at all the trouble that causes!   
Peace!

AND   
Please correct me if Im wrong, but It seems to me that silence takes many  
,many lifetimes of effort and even with that effort it needs some grace too.   
Stetching around you the infinite Universe, living beings, seemingly without  
end and not many of them are Silent.   
Nor on this little planet, very very few have there ever ever been such as  
Ramana Mahirishi! Silence no effort for this great and compassionate being  
,but for a lowly being such as I its a big effort!!!!!!!

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

This does not make any sense to me at all. Numbers are a concept of the human

thoughts... _reALity_ even, without consciousness?   
Consciousness is the source of all...everything, infinity including

infinity has no source for it is infinate, it simply _is_.

What Im saying is ALL IS ONE. If ALL = one then if you divide ONE you get  
two, divide again four and so on. So numbers are not at all a product of the  
human mind they are the result of the division of ONE. All of the percieved  
Universe and everything that IS, is as a result of this [apparent] division  
.The human mind itself exists as a result of the divisoin of ONE. All that  
exists is ONE. Existence itself cannot be dual. For this reason all that  
exists is the result of divsion!   
The SELF is SAT CHIT ANANDA. Divide it you get the Duality of subject and  
object. You get the Ego which percieves the Object [not really real though]  
and you get the objects percieved. The percieved qualities of the object the  
,ASTRAL aspect, result from the ANANDA aspect of the SELF.   
The EGO or imaginary "I", results from the Chit aspect of the SELF. When the  
duality ceases in SAMADHI The SELF is revealed as being only ONE.   
Everything fits together, everything is logical, everything makes sense.   
And ALL that exists is CONSCIUOSNESS   
And CONSCIUOSNESS is only ONE!

What requirement does is'ness have for the words "ALL" and "ONE" except for  
the processing of thoughts which simply binds oneself from recognising the  
thought's source, that which IS...   
Perhaps one should focus their attention on the meaning of ALL aswell as  
ONENESS. ALL is infinity, this is why i asked earlier, _how can you divide  
infinity?_ All divisions are created by mathmatical concepts of the mind.

That which lies beyond the Primal Cause can only be experienced and not  
defined by words, call it division or whatever you like, these words are  
calculated and formed within the mind.

What Im saying is ALL IS ONE. If ALL = one then if you divide ONE you get  
two, divide again four and so on. So numbers are not at all a product of the  
human mind they are the result of the division of ONE. All of the percieved  
Universe and everything that IS, is as a result of this [apparent] division  
.The human mind itself exists as a result of the divisoin of ONE. All that  
exists is ONE. Existence itself cannot be dual. For this reason all that  
exists is the result of divsion!   
The SELF is SAT CHIT ANANDA. Divide it you get the Duality of subject and  
object. You get the Ego which percieves the Object [not really real though]  
and you get the objects percieved. The percieved qualities of the object the  
,ASTRAL aspect, result from the ANANDA aspect of the SELF.   
The EGO or imaginary "I", results from the Chit aspect of the SELF. When the  
duality ceases in SAMADHI The SELF is revealed as being only ONE.   
Everything fits together, everything is logical, everything makes sense.   
And ALL that exists is CONSCIUOSNESS   
And CONSCIUOSNESS is only ONE!   
And RAMANA was/is for me the Greatest, most wonerfull GURU of all.   
Everything he did.   
Every word he spoke.   
All examples of what we could/are/be.   
A shining light in the darkness of samsara!!   
A beacon!!!

What requirement does is'ness have for the words "ALL" and "ONE" except for  
the processing of thoughts which simply binds oneself from recognising the  
thought's source, that which IS...   
Perhaps one should focus their attention on the meaning of ALL aswell as  
ONENESS. ALL is infinity, this is why i asked earlier, _how can you divide  
infinity?_ All divisions are created by mathmatical concepts of the mind.

calculated and formed within the mind.

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

ALSO   
I notice that when someone went to Ramana with a philosohical question, like"  
why would God will this way? " Ramana ANSWERS THE QUESTION!!!. He doesnt make  
comments about the questioners LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT. Ramana  
does his best to answer the question.   
He doesnt see himself as some superior being looking down on the questioner.   
This is the real thing !!!!100% enlighened being, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   
No trying to get followers.   
No feeling of superiority.

Consciousness is the source of all...everything, infinity including  
perceptions of number and equation, but numbers are not the source of reality,  
infinity has no source for it is infinate, it simply _is_.

If the END and the BEGINING are merely facets[percieved] of the same ONE then  
cause and effect do not exist. I take it that cause and effect are what you  
mean by consequence!!   
PEACE

hmmm, yes, i was refering to consequence in the context of cause and effect,  
but i was stating that they are an illusion, which is similer to what you were  
saying. Cause and effect does exist within the illusionary realms of thought,  
but are irrelavant to the self.   
Beggining and end are also illusions of thought. How can you divide infinity?  
(ha haaa yes, i'm aware that you are probably already thinking along these  
lines )   
Nell   
What Im saying is ALL IS ONE. If ALL = one then if you divide ONE you get  
two, divide again four and so on. So numbers are not at all a product of the  
human mind they are the result of the division of ONE. All of the percieved  
Universe and everything that IS, is as a result of this [apparent] division  
.The human mind itself exists as a result of the divisoin of ONE. All that  
exists is ONE. Existence itself cannot be dual. For this reason all that  
exists is the result of divsion!   
The SELF is SAT CHIT ANANDA. Divide it you get the Duality of subject and  
object. You get the Ego which percieves the Object [not really real though]  
and you get the objects percieved. The percieved qualities of the object the  
,ASTRAL aspect, result from the ANANDA aspect of the SELF.   
The EGO or imaginary "I", results from the Chit aspect of the SELF. When the  
duality ceases in SAMADHI The SELF is revealed as being only ONE.   
Everything fits together, everything is logical, everything makes sense.   
And ALL that exists is CONSCIUOSNESS   
And CONSCIUOSNESS is only ONE!   
And RAMANA was/is for me the Greatest, most wonerfull GURU of all.   
Everything he did.   
Every word he spoke.   
All examples of what we could/are/be.

What requirement does is'ness have for the words "ALL" and "ONE" except for  
the processing of thoughts which simply binds oneself from recognising the

Perhaps one should focus their attention on the meaning of ALL aswell as  
ONENESS. ALL is infinity, this is why i asked earlier, _how can you divide  
infinity?_ All divisions are created by mathmatical concepts of the mind.

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

ALSO   
I notice that when someone went to Ramana with a philosohical question, like"  
why would God will this way? " Ramana ANSWERS THE QUESTION!!!. He doesnt make  
comments about the questioners LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT. Ramana  
does his best to answer the question.   
He doesnt see himself as some superior being looking down on the questioner.   
This is the real thing !!!!100% enlighened being, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   
No trying to get followers.   
No feeling of superiority.

Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

I notice that when someone went to Ramana with a philosohical question, like"  
why would God will this way? " Ramana ANSWERS THE QUESTION!!!. He doesnt make  
comments about the questioners LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT. Ramana  
does his best to answer the question.   
He doesnt see himself as some superior being looking down on the questioner.

What Im saying is ALL IS ONE. If ALL = one then if you divide ONE you get  
two, divide again four and so on. So numbers are not at all a product of the  
human mind they are the result of the division of ONE. All of the percieved  
Universe and everything that IS, is as a result of this [apparent] division  
.The human mind itself exists as a result of the divisoin of ONE. All that  
exists is ONE. Existence itself cannot be dual. For this reason all that  
exists is the result of divsion!   
The SELF is SAT CHIT ANANDA. Divide it you get the Duality of subject and  
object. You get the Ego which percieves the Object [not really real though]  
and you get the objects percieved. The percieved qualities of the object the  
,ASTRAL aspect, result from the ANANDA aspect of the SELF.   
The EGO or imaginary "I", results from the Chit aspect of the SELF. When the  
duality ceases in SAMADHI The SELF is revealed as being only ONE.   
Everything fits together, everything is logical, everything makes sense.   
And ALL that exists is CONSCIUOSNESS   
And CONSCIUOSNESS is only ONE!   
And RAMANA was/is for me the Greatest, most wonerfull GURU of all.   
Everything he did.   
Every word he spoke.   
All examples of what we could/are/be.   
A shining light in the darkness of samsara!!

What requirement does is'ness have for the words "ALL" and "ONE" except for  
the processing of thoughts which simply binds oneself from recognising the  
thought's source, that which IS...   
Perhaps one should focus their attention on the meaning of ALL aswell as  
ONENESS. ALL is infinity, this is why i asked earlier, _how can you divide  
infinity?_ All divisions are created by mathmatical concepts of the mind.

calculated and formed within the mind.

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as

hmmm, yes, i was refering to consequence in the context of cause and effect,  
but i was stating that they are an illusion, which is similer to what you were  
saying. Cause and effect does exist within the illusionary realms of thought,  
but are irrelavant to the self.   
Beggining and end are also illusions of thought. How can you divide infinity?

If you divide ONE you get two, divide again, four and so on. This means that  
numbers [and the nature of all things] are the nature of reality.  
This does not make any sense to me at all. Numbers are a concept of the human  
mind. How could you prove the relavance of numbers and any equations,  
thoughts... _reALity_ even, without consciousness?

What requirement does is'ness have for the words "ALL" and "ONE" except for  
the processing of thoughts which simply binds oneself from recognising the  
thought's source, that which IS...   
Perhaps one should focus their attention on the meaning of ALL aswell as  
ONENESS. ALL is infinity, this is why i asked earlier, _how can you divide  
infinity?_ All divisions are created by mathmatical concepts of the mind.

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

ALSO   
I notice that when someone went to Ramana with a philosohical question, like"  
why would God will this way? " Ramana ANSWERS THE QUESTION!!!. He doesnt make  
comments about the questioners LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT. Ramana  
does his best to answer the question.   
He doesnt see himself as some superior being looking down on the questioner.   
This is the real thing !!!!100% enlighened being, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   
No trying to get followers.   
No feeling of superiority.

How could you divide oneness without Consciousness?

All of the percieved Universe and everything that IS, is as a result of this  
[apparent] division. The human mind itself exists as a result of the divisoin  
of ONE.  
Consciousness is constant and undivided, divisions are the bindings of  
thought.   
Quote from: mick hutchinson on June 09, 2007, 03:52:13 PM  
All that exists is ONE. Existence itself cannot be dual.  
Yes.   
Quote from: mick hutchinson on June 09, 2007, 03:52:13 PM  
For this reason all that exists is the result of divsion!  
That which lies beyond the Primal Cause can only be experienced and not  
defined by words, call it division or whatever you like, these words are  
calculated and formed within the mind.   
NICE ONE!!

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

This does not make any sense to me at all. Numbers are a concept of the human  
mind. How could you prove the relavance of numbers and any equations,  
thoughts... _reALity_ even, without consciousness?   
Consciousness is the source of all...everything, infinity including

infinity has no source for it is infinate, it simply _is_.

Beggining and end are also illusions of thought. How can you divide infinity?

What requirement does is'ness have for the words "ALL" and "ONE" except for  
the processing of thoughts which simply binds oneself from recognising the  
thought's source, that which IS...   
Perhaps one should focus their attention on the meaning of ALL aswell as  
ONENESS. ALL is infinity, this is why i asked earlier, _how can you divide  
infinity?_ All divisions are created by mathmatical concepts of the mind.

This does not make any sense to me at all. Numbers are a concept of the human

thoughts... _reALity_ even, without consciousness?   
Consciousness is the source of all...everything, infinity including

infinity has no source for it is infinate, it simply _is_.

What requirement does is'ness have for the words "ALL" and "ONE" except for  
the processing of thoughts which simply binds oneself from recognising the  
thought's source, that which IS...   
Perhaps one should focus their attention on the meaning of ALL aswell as  
ONENESS. ALL is infinity, this is why i asked earlier, _how can you divide  
infinity?_ All divisions are created by mathmatical concepts of the mind.

Author: mick hutchinson     Date: January 27, 2007, 08:51:40 PM

I got this idea from repeatedly reading instructions to Sivarakasam Pillai.   
Why are things the way they are?   
If all that exists is ONE,   
If you divide ONE you get TWO,   
Divide again FOUR   
And again EIGHT.   
And so on.   
So this means that numbers and mathematics were NOT CREATED!!   
They are just a simple fact of the nature of reality!   
From this we might deduce that all of matter and the very existence of the  
Universe and all its laws are the same.   
No matter many universes there might be, no matter how many sub-atomic  
particles are found, they are ALL are result of the division of ONE. And the  
ONE is ALL!   
So all that exists is the nature of REALITY, uncreated, eternal unchanging and  
unchangeable!!

ALSO   
Another concept which seems to explain existence.   
What would exixts if nithing at all existed?   
No stars no planets.   
No matter.   
No space.   
No time.   
A VOID, in which there was nothing.   
Well the VOID would still exist!!   
Therefore EXISTENCE IS!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
I mean what would there be if there was non exixtence?   
There is no such thing as non being!   
One cannot even concieve of non exixstence.   
I dont mean the non existence of the material Universes ~~.   
............................................................   
And as consciousness is known to be.   
Then consciuosness is what IS!!   
Nothing could exist if there was not anything to be consciuos of it!   
Only consciuosness exists!~~

1;All over the world people fight and kill each other for conflicting  
ideologies.   
Crazy ideas about the nature of God and the nature of reality.   
2;The computer with which we comunicate and the science tha created it are  
part of the investigation into the nature of physical reality.   
Surley it must be right to have concepts on the mental plane which get as near  
as is possible to the truth, rather than some of the ideas which are around  
,which are close to complete madness.   
The constant refining and updating of the mental and verbal ideas to get them  
closer to the Ultimate Truth must surely be a good thing? And might help  
others who follow the path. Isnt this just what all books on this subject do?   
Peace!!!

Books after all are views....ideologies are mine, yours and theirs...Baghvan  
was many times asked/ hinted why He is so quite when all of India was burning.  
His answer was always the same...improve our own attitude.   
Research into Religion, nature of God, heaven and hell has not made us any  
better. As on Dec 2006, the scientist are trying to solve BIG BANG. Concept  
is a thought. Imagine the whole world in deep sleep...then during that  
sleep....there is no world...a concept isn't it. So very temporary.   
I am who I am... all the refining and updating on mental plane leaves me  
stranded. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni was a refined man...well versed in all that  
books had to offer, yet he knew something was not right. And he got his  
answer.   
I can help a blind person to cross the road.... I surely cannot help if he  
blames the whole world for his darkness.   
I have to change my attitude...I have to unlearn and start all over  
again....and for this I need lot of LOVE and Faith... Bhakti...Devotion...

captmj   
I suggest you have a look at David Godmans book "Be as you are"   
You wil see that Ramana always answered sincere questions intelligently and  
lucidly.   
And he used metaphors from the modern world!! For instance his likening of the  
percieved world to the picture on a movie screen and saying that it is like  
the audience AND the actors being on the screen simultaneously !! Look at his  
replies to al the questions about the nature of things.   
You yourself are using thought to comunicate and are constantly forming  
concepts as you relate to material life.   
Everything has its place and what might loosely be called purpose.Without the  
process of conceptualisation you wouldnt know anything at all !!   
If you look at the world around you its possible to see, in a quite practical  
way that it is a picture WITHIN you. As Ramana said there is no inside and  
outside for the self. Certain psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD cause  
perception of the world to be distorted, making it plain that what we percieve  
to be the world is no more than a picture within us ! My one experience of  
Nirvikapala Samadhi and the Kundalini was in 1971 on LSD.   
So these statements that the world isnt real are actualy true!! In the sense  
that what we percieve as the world is, I qoute Ramana, "cordinated sense  
impressions",   
The picture of the world is created from cordinated sense impressions. The  
qualities that we experience, pleasant, bad, good, nice nasty, these are all  
the mind. Astral energy made from Sat Chit Ananda. The division [apparent ] of  
the Self into Duality gives rise to the mind and all its machinations. So I  
observe this within, in daily life. I recognise the process of mind as much as  
I am able.   
The mind is nescessary otherwise no forward progress is possible.   
Improve your attitude ? Knowing the truth at all levels possible IS improving  
your attitude!   
Peace   
Mick!!!

. ..Hello Mick   
There is no conflict...only varied interpretation. It used to happen right in  
front of Baghavan.   
Did I reject concepts...I dont think so. I am attempting to separate the ego I  
from the concepts...Yes I agree the world will be as long as there is  
impressions and concepts. Statements that world is untrue are statements...  
when the untruth is preceived, no statement will be necessary.   
To me Baghvan is silence...   
As Ramana says..mind turned inwards is pure and pure mind is Atma or truth  
...whatever the name is...   
And only by improving the attitude will lead me to truth at all levels or for  
that matter beyond levels..turiyattita.   
Till that time I need mind to improve my mind, material mind has to unlearn  
and turn within.   
Yours In Baghvan

Thats right. its what I meant.   
Varied interpretation, different interpretations suit different personalities.  
It must be a good thing if things can be seen to make sense!   
For me Ramana was/is the greatest guru of all time.   
Silence is hard to achieve.   
I get it that the I thought isnt the self, that if the I thought is a thought  
then there would seem to have to be an experiencer of the I thought. Also that  
this experiencer isnt real, it doesent exist. I sort of get it. I guess thats  
the limit of where the mind can go!   
But I do try!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding.

No Mick. ...havent seen the film...will when i get the chance.   
I am almost on a flight to Lagos and waiting at the lounge with Nan Yar in my  
pocket....well you started the thread and it was good. So here I am checking  
out what you had to say next...I am reading question 21 of the dialogue..   
Sivaprakasam Pillai : Is enquiry into scriptural teaching necessary for an  
earnest seeker ?   
Bagahvan : As there is no use in analysing the garbage collected, so it is  
with an earnest seeker who is searching for his-self,.There is no use for a  
person who wants to understand his -self, instead of discarding the ignorance  
that hides his- self, does research on his-self. This prapancham...crudely  
translated in English as "world " . .. ( for want of better description)  
should be perceived as a dream...   
Now then is it necessary for us to analyse nature of reality   
Swami Dayananda in his commentary on Upadesa Saram says...thoughts are of 2  
types. ..mechanical and purposeful....   
mechanical thoughts are destructive. ...so lets avoid mechanical thoughts....a  
mind over which there is no control is a monkey...

The post is ABOUT holding onto the perception of the world as a dream!!   
By realising that perception off the world is a picture manufactured by the  
mind out of cosciuossness.   
Thats why I started the post.   
I say to myself that is isnt real, that what Im seeing is an illusion. that  
the experiences that Ive had show me this.   
Otherwise I forget and start taking the ups and downs of material life  
seriously!!!   
And if I can get it into a more concise verbal form , or use a more modern  
metaphor it makes conversation with anyone else who is interested easier!!!!   
I talk for a living!!   
Peace, love and understanding   
Mick!!!

silence is hard to achieve. ... mick   
the truth is it takes energy to think thoughts, and silence requires no  
energy at all.   
if what you want is truth, you will not find it in reason. following  
thoughts leads away from truth.

Tell me did you think when you repllied to the post?   
How can there be a discusion forum without thoughts?   
Silence takes no enegy for Who?   
Strange how people here, instead of discusng the topic give wise advice. I

Be careful that you do not make a dogma out of what should be an honest quest  
.That is the way of religion, and look at all the trouble that causes!

Please correct me if Im wrong, but It seems to me that silence takes many  
,many lifetimes of effort and even with that effort it needs some grace too.   
Stetching around you the infinite Universe, living beings, seemingly without  
end and not many of them are Silent.   
Nor on this little planet, very very few have there ever ever been such as  
Ramana Mahirishi! Silence no effort for this great and compassionate being  
,but for a lowly being such as I its a big effort!!!!!!!

I got this idea from repeatedly reading instructions to Sivarakasam Pillai.   
Why are things the way they are?   
If all that exists is ONE,   
If you divide ONE you get TWO,   
Divide again FOUR   
And again EIGHT.   
And so on.   
So this means that numbers and mathematics were NOT CREATED!!   
They are just a simple fact of the nature of reality!   
From this we might deduce that all of matter and the very existence of the  
Universe and all its laws are the same.   
No matter many universes there might be, no matter how many sub-atomic  
particles are found, they are ALL are result of the division of ONE. And the  
ONE is ALL!   
So all that exists is the nature of REALITY, uncreated, eternal unchanging and  
unchangeable!!

All [whether real or not] Universes and beings living within the Universes.

1;All over the world people fight and kill each other for conflicting  
ideologies.   
Crazy ideas about the nature of God and the nature of reality.   
2;The computer with which we comunicate and the science tha created it are  
part of the investigation into the nature of physical reality.   
Surley it must be right to have concepts on the mental plane which get as near  
as is possible to the truth, rather than some of the ideas which are around  
,which are close to complete madness.   
The constant refining and updating of the mental and verbal ideas to get them  
closer to the Ultimate Truth must surely be a good thing? And might help  
others who follow the path. Isnt this just what all books on this subject do?   
Peace!!!

Books after all are views....ideologies are mine, yours and theirs...Baghvan  
was many times asked/ hinted why He is so quite when all of India was burning.  
His answer was always the same...improve our own attitude.   
Research into Religion, nature of God, heaven and hell has not made us any  
better. As on Dec 2006, the scientist are trying to solve BIG BANG. Concept  
is a thought. Imagine the whole world in deep sleep...then during that  
sleep....there is no world...a concept isn't it. So very temporary.   
I am who I am... all the refining and updating on mental plane leaves me  
stranded. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni was a refined man...well versed in all that  
books had to offer, yet he knew something was not right. And he got his  
answer.   
I can help a blind person to cross the road.... I surely cannot help if he  
blames the whole world for his darkness.   
I have to change my attitude...I have to unlearn and start all over  
again....and for this I need lot of LOVE and Faith... Bhakti...Devotion...

captmj   
I suggest you have a look at David Godmans book "Be as you are"   
You wil see that Ramana always answered sincere questions intelligently and  
lucidly.   
And he used metaphors from the modern world!! For instance his likening of the  
percieved world to the picture on a movie screen and saying that it is like  
the audience AND the actors being on the screen simultaneously !! Look at his  
replies to al the questions about the nature of things.   
You yourself are using thought to comunicate and are constantly forming  
concepts as you relate to material life.   
Everything has its place and what might loosely be called purpose.Without the  
process of conceptualisation you wouldnt know anything at all !!   
If you look at the world around you its possible to see, in a quite practical  
way that it is a picture WITHIN you. As Ramana said there is no inside and  
outside for the self. Certain psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD cause  
perception of the world to be distorted, making it plain that what we percieve  
to be the world is no more than a picture within us ! My one experience of  
Nirvikapala Samadhi and the Kundalini was in 1971 on LSD.   
So these statements that the world isnt real are actualy true!! In the sense  
that what we percieve as the world is, I qoute Ramana, "cordinated sense  
impressions",   
The picture of the world is created from cordinated sense impressions. The  
qualities that we experience, pleasant, bad, good, nice nasty, these are all  
the mind. Astral energy made from Sat Chit Ananda. The division [apparent ] of  
the Self into Duality gives rise to the mind and all its machinations. So I  
observe this within, in daily life. I recognise the process of mind as much as  
I am able.   
The mind is nescessary otherwise no forward progress is possible.   
Improve your attitude ? Knowing the truth at all levels possible IS improving  
your attitude!   
Peace   
Mick!!!

. ..Hello Mick   
There is no conflict...only varied interpretation. It used to happen right in  
front of Baghavan.   
Did I reject concepts...I dont think so. I am attempting to separate the ego I  
from the concepts...Yes I agree the world will be as long as there is  
impressions and concepts. Statements that world is untrue are statements...  
when the untruth is preceived, no statement will be necessary.   
To me Baghvan is silence...   
As Ramana says..mind turned inwards is pure and pure mind is Atma or truth  
...whatever the name is...   
And only by improving the attitude will lead me to truth at all levels or for  
that matter beyond levels..turiyattita.   
Till that time I need mind to improve my mind, material mind has to unlearn  
and turn within.   
Yours In Baghvan

Thats right. its what I meant.   
Varied interpretation, different interpretations suit different personalities.  
It must be a good thing if things can be seen to make sense!   
For me Ramana was/is the greatest guru of all time.   
Silence is hard to achieve.   
I get it that the I thought isnt the self, that if the I thought is a thought  
then there would seem to have to be an experiencer of the I thought. Also that  
this experiencer isnt real, it doesent exist. I sort of get it. I guess thats  
the limit of where the mind can go!   
But I do try!!

No Mick. ...havent seen the film...will when i get the chance.   
I am almost on a flight to Lagos and waiting at the lounge with Nan Yar in my  
pocket....well you started the thread and it was good. So here I am checking  
out what you had to say next...I am reading question 21 of the dialogue..   
Sivaprakasam Pillai : Is enquiry into scriptural teaching necessary for an  
earnest seeker ?   
Bagahvan : As there is no use in analysing the garbage collected, so it is  
with an earnest seeker who is searching for his-self,.There is no use for a  
person who wants to understand his -self, instead of discarding the ignorance  
that hides his- self, does research on his-self. This prapancham...crudely  
translated in English as "world " . .. ( for want of better description)  
should be perceived as a dream...   
Now then is it necessary for us to analyse nature of reality   
Swami Dayananda in his commentary on Upadesa Saram says...thoughts are of 2  
types. ..mechanical and purposeful....   
mechanical thoughts are destructive. ...so lets avoid mechanical thoughts....a  
mind over which there is no control is a monkey...

1;All over the world people fight and kill each other for conflicting  
ideologies.   
Crazy ideas about the nature of God and the nature of reality.   
2;The computer with which we comunicate and the science tha created it are  
part of the investigation into the nature of physical reality.   
Surley it must be right to have concepts on the mental plane which get as near  
as is possible to the truth, rather than some of the ideas which are around  
,which are close to complete madness.   
The constant refining and updating of the mental and verbal ideas to get them  
closer to the Ultimate Truth must surely be a good thing? And might help  
others who follow the path. Isnt this just what all books on this subject do?

Books after all are views....ideologies are mine, yours and theirs...Baghvan  
was many times asked/ hinted why He is so quite when all of India was burning.  
His answer was always the same...improve our own attitude.   
Research into Religion, nature of God, heaven and hell has not made us any  
better. As on Dec 2006, the scientist are trying to solve BIG BANG. Concept  
is a thought. Imagine the whole world in deep sleep...then during that  
sleep....there is no world...a concept isn't it. So very temporary.   
I am who I am... all the refining and updating on mental plane leaves me  
stranded. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni was a refined man...well versed in all that  
books had to offer, yet he knew something was not right. And he got his  
answer.   
I can help a blind person to cross the road.... I surely cannot help if he  
blames the whole world for his darkness.   
I have to change my attitude...I have to unlearn and start all over

I suggest you have a look at David Godmans book "Be as you are"   
You wil see that Ramana always answered sincere questions intelligently and  
lucidly.   
And he used metaphors from the modern world!! For instance his likening of the  
percieved world to the picture on a movie screen and saying that it is like  
the audience AND the actors being on the screen simultaneously !! Look at his  
replies to al the questions about the nature of things.   
You yourself are using thought to comunicate and are constantly forming  
concepts as you relate to material life.   
Everything has its place and what might loosely be called purpose.Without the  
process of conceptualisation you wouldnt know anything at all !!   
If you look at the world around you its possible to see, in a quite practical  
way that it is a picture WITHIN you. As Ramana said there is no inside and  
outside for the self. Certain psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD cause  
perception of the world to be distorted, making it plain that what we percieve  
to be the world is no more than a picture within us ! My one experience of  
Nirvikapala Samadhi and the Kundalini was in 1971 on LSD.   
So these statements that the world isnt real are actualy true!! In the sense  
that what we percieve as the world is, I qoute Ramana, "cordinated sense  
impressions",   
The picture of the world is created from cordinated sense impressions. The  
qualities that we experience, pleasant, bad, good, nice nasty, these are all  
the mind. Astral energy made from Sat Chit Ananda. The division [apparent ] of  
the Self into Duality gives rise to the mind and all its machinations. So I  
observe this within, in daily life. I recognise the process of mind as much as  
I am able.   
The mind is nescessary otherwise no forward progress is possible.   
Improve your attitude ? Knowing the truth at all levels possible IS improving  
your attitude!   
Peace   
Mick!!!

. ..Hello Mick   
There is no conflict...only varied interpretation. It used to happen right in  
front of Baghavan.   
Did I reject concepts...I dont think so. I am attempting to separate the ego I  
from the concepts...Yes I agree the world will be as long as there is  
impressions and concepts. Statements that world is untrue are statements...  
when the untruth is preceived, no statement will be necessary.   
To me Baghvan is silence...   
As Ramana says..mind turned inwards is pure and pure mind is Atma or truth  
...whatever the name is...   
And only by improving the attitude will lead me to truth at all levels or for  
that matter beyond levels..turiyattita.   
Till that time I need mind to improve my mind, material mind has to unlearn  
and turn within.   
Yours In Baghvan

Thats right. its what I meant.   
Varied interpretation, different interpretations suit different personalities.  
It must be a good thing if things can be seen to make sense!   
For me Ramana was/is the greatest guru of all time.   
Silence is hard to achieve.   
I get it that the I thought isnt the self, that if the I thought is a thought  
then there would seem to have to be an experiencer of the I thought. Also that  
this experiencer isnt real, it doesent exist. I sort of get it. I guess thats  
the limit of where the mind can go!   
But I do try!!

No Mick. ...havent seen the film...will when i get the chance.   
I am almost on a flight to Lagos and waiting at the lounge with Nan Yar in my  
pocket....well you started the thread and it was good. So here I am checking  
out what you had to say next...I am reading question 21 of the dialogue..   
Sivaprakasam Pillai : Is enquiry into scriptural teaching necessary for an  
earnest seeker ?   
Bagahvan : As there is no use in analysing the garbage collected, so it is  
with an earnest seeker who is searching for his-self,.There is no use for a  
person who wants to understand his -self, instead of discarding the ignorance  
that hides his- self, does research on his-self. This prapancham...crudely  
translated in English as "world " . .. ( for want of better description)  
should be perceived as a dream...   
Now then is it necessary for us to analyse nature of reality   
Swami Dayananda in his commentary on Upadesa Saram says...thoughts are of 2  
types. ..mechanical and purposeful....   
mechanical thoughts are destructive. ...so lets avoid mechanical thoughts....a  
mind over which there is no control is a monkey...   
In Baghvan

The post is ABOUT holding onto the perception of the world as a dream!!   
By realising that perception off the world is a picture manufactured by the  
mind out of cosciuossness.   
Thats why I started the post.   
I say to myself that is isnt real, that what Im seeing is an illusion. that  
the experiences that Ive had show me this.   
Otherwise I forget and start taking the ups and downs of material life  
seriously!!!   
And if I can get it into a more concise verbal form , or use a more modern  
metaphor it makes conversation with anyone else who is interested easier!!!!   
I talk for a living!!   
Peace, love and understanding

silence is hard to achieve. ... mick   
the truth is it takes energy to think thoughts, and silence requires no  
energy at all.   
if what you want is truth, you will not find it in reason. following  
thoughts leads away from truth.

Tell me did you think when you repllied to the post?   
How can there be a discusion forum without thoughts?   
Silence takes no enegy for Who?   
Strange how people here, instead of discusng the topic give wise advice. I  
wonder what is the cause of this?   
Be careful that you do not make a dogma out of what should be an honest quest  
.That is the way of religion, and look at all the trouble that causes!

AND   
Please correct me if Im wrong, but It seems to me that silence takes many  
,many lifetimes of effort and even with that effort it needs some grace too.   
Stetching around you the infinite Universe, living beings, seemingly without  
end and not many of them are Silent.   
Nor on this little planet, very very few have there ever ever been such as  
Ramana Mahirishi! Silence no effort for this great and compassionate being  
,but for a lowly being such as I its a big effort!!!!!!!

I got this idea from repeatedly reading instructions to Sivarakasam Pillai.   
Why are things the way they are?   
If all that exists is ONE,   
If you divide ONE you get TWO,   
Divide again FOUR   
And again EIGHT.   
And so on.   
So this means that numbers and mathematics were NOT CREATED!!   
They are just a simple fact of the nature of reality!   
From this we might deduce that all of matter and the very existence of the  
Universe and all its laws are the same.   
No matter many universes there might be, no matter how many sub-atomic  
particles are found, they are ALL are result of the division of ONE. And the  
ONE is ALL!   
So all that exists is the nature of REALITY, uncreated, eternal unchanging and  
unchangeable!!

ALSO   
Another concept which seems to explain existence.   
What would exixts if nithing at all existed?   
No stars no planets.   
No matter.   
No space.   
No time.   
A VOID, in which there was nothing.   
Well the VOID would still exist!!   
Therefore EXISTENCE IS!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
I mean what would there be if there was non exixtence?   
There is no such thing as non being!   
One cannot even concieve of non exixstence.   
I dont mean the non existence of the material Universes ~~.   
............................................................   
And as consciousness is known to be.   
Then consciuosness is what IS!!   
Nothing could exist if there was not anything to be consciuos of it!   
Only consciuosness exists!~~

Thats right. its what I meant.   
Varied interpretation, different interpretations suit different personalities.  
It must be a good thing if things can be seen to make sense!   
For me Ramana was/is the greatest guru of all time.   
Silence is hard to achieve.   
I get it that the I thought isnt the self, that if the I thought is a thought  
then there would seem to have to be an experiencer of the I thought. Also that  
this experiencer isnt real, it doesent exist. I sort of get it. I guess thats  
the limit of where the mind can go!   
But I do try!!

Thats why I started the post.   
I say to myself that is isnt real, that what Im seeing is an illusion. that  
the experiences that Ive had show me this.   
Otherwise I forget and start taking the ups and downs of material life

AND   
Please correct me if Im wrong, but It seems to me that silence takes many  
,many lifetimes of effort and even with that effort it needs some grace too.   
Stetching around you the infinite Universe, living beings, seemingly without  
end and not many of them are Silent.   
Nor on this little planet, very very few have there ever ever been such as  
Ramana Mahirishi! Silence no effort for this great and compassionate being  
,but for a lowly being such as I its a big effort!!!!!!!

I got this idea from repeatedly reading instructions to Sivarakasam Pillai.   
Why are things the way they are?   
If all that exists is ONE,   
If you divide ONE you get TWO,   
Divide again FOUR   
And again EIGHT.   
And so on.   
So this means that numbers and mathematics were NOT CREATED!!   
They are just a simple fact of the nature of reality!   
From this we might deduce that all of matter and the very existence of the  
Universe and all its laws are the same.   
No matter many universes there might be, no matter how many sub-atomic  
particles are found, they are ALL are result of the division of ONE. And the  
ONE is ALL!   
So all that exists is the nature of REALITY, uncreated, eternal unchanging and  
unchangeable!!

ALSO   
Another concept which seems to explain existence.   
What would exixts if nithing at all existed?   
No stars no planets.   
No matter.   
No space.   
No time.   
A VOID, in which there was nothing.   
Well the VOID would still exist!!   
Therefore EXISTENCE IS!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
I mean what would there be if there was non exixtence?   
There is no such thing as non being!   
One cannot even concieve of non exixstence.   
I dont mean the non existence of the material Universes ~~.   
............................................................   
And as consciousness is known to be.   
Then consciuosness is what IS!!   
Nothing could exist if there was not anything to be consciuos of it!   
Only consciuosness exists!~~

So   
If the previous two posts are true.   
Then.   
All that happens,   
All percieved events.   
All [whether real or not] Universes and beings living within the Universes.   
All these exist as a consequence of the Nature of reality.

1;All over the world people fight and kill each other for conflicting  
ideologies.   
Crazy ideas about the nature of God and the nature of reality.   
2;The computer with which we comunicate and the science tha created it are  
part of the investigation into the nature of physical reality.   
Surley it must be right to have concepts on the mental plane which get as near  
as is possible to the truth, rather than some of the ideas which are around  
,which are close to complete madness.   
The constant refining and updating of the mental and verbal ideas to get them  
closer to the Ultimate Truth must surely be a good thing? And might help  
others who follow the path. Isnt this just what all books on this subject do?   
Peace!!!

Books after all are views....ideologies are mine, yours and theirs...Baghvan  
was many times asked/ hinted why He is so quite when all of India was burning.  
His answer was always the same...improve our own attitude.   
Research into Religion, nature of God, heaven and hell has not made us any  
better. As on Dec 2006, the scientist are trying to solve BIG BANG. Concept  
is a thought. Imagine the whole world in deep sleep...then during that  
sleep....there is no world...a concept isn't it. So very temporary.   
I am who I am... all the refining and updating on mental plane leaves me  
stranded. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni was a refined man...well versed in all that  
books had to offer, yet he knew something was not right. And he got his  
answer.   
I can help a blind person to cross the road.... I surely cannot help if he  
blames the whole world for his darkness.   
I have to change my attitude...I have to unlearn and start all over  
again....and for this I need lot of LOVE and Faith... Bhakti...Devotion...

captmj   
I suggest you have a look at David Godmans book "Be as you are"   
You wil see that Ramana always answered sincere questions intelligently and  
lucidly.   
And he used metaphors from the modern world!! For instance his likening of the  
percieved world to the picture on a movie screen and saying that it is like  
the audience AND the actors being on the screen simultaneously !! Look at his  
replies to al the questions about the nature of things.   
You yourself are using thought to comunicate and are constantly forming  
concepts as you relate to material life.   
Everything has its place and what might loosely be called purpose.Without the  
process of conceptualisation you wouldnt know anything at all !!   
If you look at the world around you its possible to see, in a quite practical  
way that it is a picture WITHIN you. As Ramana said there is no inside and  
outside for the self. Certain psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD cause  
perception of the world to be distorted, making it plain that what we percieve  
to be the world is no more than a picture within us ! My one experience of  
Nirvikapala Samadhi and the Kundalini was in 1971 on LSD.   
So these statements that the world isnt real are actualy true!! In the sense  
that what we percieve as the world is, I qoute Ramana, "cordinated sense  
impressions",   
The picture of the world is created from cordinated sense impressions. The  
qualities that we experience, pleasant, bad, good, nice nasty, these are all  
the mind. Astral energy made from Sat Chit Ananda. The division [apparent ] of  
the Self into Duality gives rise to the mind and all its machinations. So I  
observe this within, in daily life. I recognise the process of mind as much as  
I am able.   
The mind is nescessary otherwise no forward progress is possible.   
Improve your attitude ? Knowing the truth at all levels possible IS improving  
your attitude!   
Peace   
Mick!!!

. ..Hello Mick   
There is no conflict...only varied interpretation. It used to happen right in  
front of Baghavan.   
Did I reject concepts...I dont think so. I am attempting to separate the ego I  
from the concepts...Yes I agree the world will be as long as there is  
impressions and concepts. Statements that world is untrue are statements...  
when the untruth is preceived, no statement will be necessary.   
To me Baghvan is silence...   
As Ramana says..mind turned inwards is pure and pure mind is Atma or truth  
...whatever the name is...   
And only by improving the attitude will lead me to truth at all levels or for  
that matter beyond levels..turiyattita.   
Till that time I need mind to improve my mind, material mind has to unlearn

Please correct me if Im wrong, but It seems to me that silence takes many  
,many lifetimes of effort and even with that effort it needs some grace too.   
Stetching around you the infinite Universe, living beings, seemingly without  
end and not many of them are Silent.   
Nor on this little planet, very very few have there ever ever been such as  
Ramana Mahirishi! Silence no effort for this great and compassionate being  
,but for a lowly being such as I its a big effort!!!!!!!

I got this idea from repeatedly reading instructions to Sivarakasam Pillai.   
Why are things the way they are?   
If all that exists is ONE,   
If you divide ONE you get TWO,   
Divide again FOUR   
And again EIGHT.   
And so on.   
So this means that numbers and mathematics were NOT CREATED!!   
They are just a simple fact of the nature of reality!   
From this we might deduce that all of matter and the very existence of the  
Universe and all its laws are the same.   
No matter many universes there might be, no matter how many sub-atomic  
particles are found, they are ALL are result of the division of ONE. And the  
ONE is ALL!   
So all that exists is the nature of REALITY, uncreated, eternal unchanging and  
unchangeable!!

Books after all are views....ideologies are mine, yours and theirs...Baghvan  
was many times asked/ hinted why He is so quite when all of India was burning.  
His answer was always the same...improve our own attitude.   
Research into Religion, nature of God, heaven and hell has not made us any  
better. As on Dec 2006, the scientist are trying to solve BIG BANG. Concept  
is a thought. Imagine the whole world in deep sleep...then during that  
sleep....there is no world...a concept isn't it. So very temporary.   
I am who I am... all the refining and updating on mental plane leaves me  
stranded. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni was a refined man...well versed in all that  
books had to offer, yet he knew something was not right. And he got his  
answer.   
I can help a blind person to cross the road.... I surely cannot help if he  
blames the whole world for his darkness.   
I have to change my attitude...I have to unlearn and start all over  
again....and for this I need lot of LOVE and Faith... Bhakti...Devotion...

captmj   
I suggest you have a look at David Godmans book "Be as you are"   
You wil see that Ramana always answered sincere questions intelligently and  
lucidly.   
And he used metaphors from the modern world!! For instance his likening of the  
percieved world to the picture on a movie screen and saying that it is like  
the audience AND the actors being on the screen simultaneously !! Look at his  
replies to al the questions about the nature of things.   
You yourself are using thought to comunicate and are constantly forming  
concepts as you relate to material life.   
Everything has its place and what might loosely be called purpose.Without the  
process of conceptualisation you wouldnt know anything at all !!   
If you look at the world around you its possible to see, in a quite practical  
way that it is a picture WITHIN you. As Ramana said there is no inside and  
outside for the self. Certain psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD cause  
perception of the world to be distorted, making it plain that what we percieve  
to be the world is no more than a picture within us ! My one experience of  
Nirvikapala Samadhi and the Kundalini was in 1971 on LSD.   
So these statements that the world isnt real are actualy true!! In the sense  
that what we percieve as the world is, I qoute Ramana, "cordinated sense  
impressions",   
The picture of the world is created from cordinated sense impressions. The  
qualities that we experience, pleasant, bad, good, nice nasty, these are all  
the mind. Astral energy made from Sat Chit Ananda. The division [apparent ] of  
the Self into Duality gives rise to the mind and all its machinations. So I  
observe this within, in daily life. I recognise the process of mind as much as  
I am able.   
The mind is nescessary otherwise no forward progress is possible.   
Improve your attitude ? Knowing the truth at all levels possible IS improving  
your attitude!   
Peace   
Mick!!!

. ..Hello Mick   
There is no conflict...only varied interpretation. It used to happen right in  
front of Baghavan.   
Did I reject concepts...I dont think so. I am attempting to separate the ego I  
from the concepts...Yes I agree the world will be as long as there is  
impressions and concepts. Statements that world is untrue are statements...  
when the untruth is preceived, no statement will be necessary.   
To me Baghvan is silence...   
As Ramana says..mind turned inwards is pure and pure mind is Atma or truth  
...whatever the name is...   
And only by improving the attitude will lead me to truth at all levels or for  
that matter beyond levels..turiyattita.   
Till that time I need mind to improve my mind, material mind has to unlearn  
and turn within.   
Yours In Baghvan

Thats right. its what I meant.   
Varied interpretation, different interpretations suit different personalities.  
It must be a good thing if things can be seen to make sense!   
For me Ramana was/is the greatest guru of all time.   
Silence is hard to achieve.   
I get it that the I thought isnt the self, that if the I thought is a thought  
then there would seem to have to be an experiencer of the I thought. Also that  
this experiencer isnt real, it doesent exist. I sort of get it. I guess thats  
the limit of where the mind can go!   
But I do try!!

No Mick. ...havent seen the film...will when i get the chance.   
I am almost on a flight to Lagos and waiting at the lounge with Nan Yar in my  
pocket....well you started the thread and it was good. So here I am checking  
out what you had to say next...I am reading question 21 of the dialogue..   
Sivaprakasam Pillai : Is enquiry into scriptural teaching necessary for an  
earnest seeker ?   
Bagahvan : As there is no use in analysing the garbage collected, so it is  
with an earnest seeker who is searching for his-self,.There is no use for a  
person who wants to understand his -self, instead of discarding the ignorance  
that hides his- self, does research on his-self. This prapancham...crudely  
translated in English as "world " . .. ( for want of better description)  
should be perceived as a dream...   
Now then is it necessary for us to analyse nature of reality   
Swami Dayananda in his commentary on Upadesa Saram says...thoughts are of 2  
types. ..mechanical and purposeful....   
mechanical thoughts are destructive. ...so lets avoid mechanical thoughts....a  
mind over which there is no control is a monkey...   
In Baghvan

The post is ABOUT holding onto the perception of the world as a dream!!   
By realising that perception off the world is a picture manufactured by the  
mind out of cosciuossness.   
Thats why I started the post.   
I say to myself that is isnt real, that what Im seeing is an illusion. that  
the experiences that Ive had show me this.   
Otherwise I forget and start taking the ups and downs of material life  
seriously!!!   
And if I can get it into a more concise verbal form , or use a more modern  
metaphor it makes conversation with anyone else who is interested easier!!!!   
I talk for a living!!

the truth is it takes energy to think thoughts, and silence requires no

if what you want is truth, you will not find it in reason. following

Tell me did you think when you repllied to the post?   
How can there be a discusion forum without thoughts?   
Silence takes no enegy for Who?   
Strange how people here, instead of discusng the topic give wise advice. I  
wonder what is the cause of this?   
Be careful that you do not make a dogma out of what should be an honest quest  
.That is the way of religion, and look at all the trouble that causes!

I suggest you have a look at David Godmans book "Be as you are"   
You wil see that Ramana always answered sincere questions intelligently and  
lucidly.   
And he used metaphors from the modern world!! For instance his likening of the  
percieved world to the picture on a movie screen and saying that it is like  
the audience AND the actors being on the screen simultaneously !! Look at his  
replies to al the questions about the nature of things.   
You yourself are using thought to comunicate and are constantly forming  
concepts as you relate to material life.   
Everything has its place and what might loosely be called purpose.Without the  
process of conceptualisation you wouldnt know anything at all !!   
If you look at the world around you its possible to see, in a quite practical  
way that it is a picture WITHIN you. As Ramana said there is no inside and  
outside for the self. Certain psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD cause  
perception of the world to be distorted, making it plain that what we percieve  
to be the world is no more than a picture within us ! My one experience of  
Nirvikapala Samadhi and the Kundalini was in 1971 on LSD.   
So these statements that the world isnt real are actualy true!! In the sense  
that what we percieve as the world is, I qoute Ramana, "cordinated sense  
impressions",   
The picture of the world is created from cordinated sense impressions. The  
qualities that we experience, pleasant, bad, good, nice nasty, these are all  
the mind. Astral energy made from Sat Chit Ananda. The division [apparent ] of  
the Self into Duality gives rise to the mind and all its machinations. So I  
observe this within, in daily life. I recognise the process of mind as much as  
I am able.   
The mind is nescessary otherwise no forward progress is possible.   
Improve your attitude ? Knowing the truth at all levels possible IS improving  
your attitude!   
Peace   
Mick!!!

. ..Hello Mick   
There is no conflict...only varied interpretation. It used to happen right in  
front of Baghavan.   
Did I reject concepts...I dont think so. I am attempting to separate the ego I  
from the concepts...Yes I agree the world will be as long as there is  
impressions and concepts. Statements that world is untrue are statements...  
when the untruth is preceived, no statement will be necessary.   
To me Baghvan is silence...   
As Ramana says..mind turned inwards is pure and pure mind is Atma or truth  
...whatever the name is...   
And only by improving the attitude will lead me to truth at all levels or for  
that matter beyond levels..turiyattita.   
Till that time I need mind to improve my mind, material mind has to unlearn  
and turn within.   
Yours In Baghvan

No Mick. ...havent seen the film...will when i get the chance.   
I am almost on a flight to Lagos and waiting at the lounge with Nan Yar in my  
pocket....well you started the thread and it was good. So here I am checking  
out what you had to say next...I am reading question 21 of the dialogue..   
Sivaprakasam Pillai : Is enquiry into scriptural teaching necessary for an  
earnest seeker ?   
Bagahvan : As there is no use in analysing the garbage collected, so it is  
with an earnest seeker who is searching for his-self,.There is no use for a  
person who wants to understand his -self, instead of discarding the ignorance  
that hides his- self, does research on his-self. This prapancham...crudely  
translated in English as "world " . .. ( for want of better description)  
should be perceived as a dream...   
Now then is it necessary for us to analyse nature of reality   
Swami Dayananda in his commentary on Upadesa Saram says...thoughts are of 2  
types. ..mechanical and purposeful....   
mechanical thoughts are destructive. ...so lets avoid mechanical thoughts....a  
mind over which there is no control is a monkey...

The post is ABOUT holding onto the perception of the world as a dream!!   
By realising that perception off the world is a picture manufactured by the  
mind out of cosciuossness.   
Thats why I started the post.   
I say to myself that is isnt real, that what Im seeing is an illusion. that  
the experiences that Ive had show me this.   
Otherwise I forget and start taking the ups and downs of material life  
seriously!!!   
And if I can get it into a more concise verbal form , or use a more modern  
metaphor it makes conversation with anyone else who is interested easier!!!!   
I talk for a living!!   
Peace, love and understanding

silence is hard to achieve. ... mick   
the truth is it takes energy to think thoughts, and silence requires no  
energy at all.   
if what you want is truth, you will not find it in reason. following  
thoughts leads away from truth.

Tell me did you think when you repllied to the post?   
How can there be a discusion forum without thoughts?   
Silence takes no enegy for Who?   
Strange how people here, instead of discusng the topic give wise advice. I  
wonder what is the cause of this?   
Be careful that you do not make a dogma out of what should be an honest quest  
.That is the way of religion, and look at all the trouble that causes!

AND   
Please correct me if Im wrong, but It seems to me that silence takes many  
,many lifetimes of effort and even with that effort it needs some grace too.   
Stetching around you the infinite Universe, living beings, seemingly without  
end and not many of them are Silent.   
Nor on this little planet, very very few have there ever ever been such as  
Ramana Mahirishi! Silence no effort for this great and compassionate being  
,but for a lowly being such as I its a big effort!!!!!!!

I got this idea from repeatedly reading instructions to Sivarakasam Pillai.   
Why are things the way they are?   
If all that exists is ONE,   
If you divide ONE you get TWO,   
Divide again FOUR   
And again EIGHT.   
And so on.   
So this means that numbers and mathematics were NOT CREATED!!   
They are just a simple fact of the nature of reality!   
From this we might deduce that all of matter and the very existence of the  
Universe and all its laws are the same.   
No matter many universes there might be, no matter how many sub-atomic  
particles are found, they are ALL are result of the division of ONE. And the  
ONE is ALL!   
So all that exists is the nature of REALITY, uncreated, eternal unchanging and  
unchangeable!!

ALSO   
Another concept which seems to explain existence.   
What would exixts if nithing at all existed?   
No stars no planets.   
No matter.   
No space.   
No time.   
A VOID, in which there was nothing.   
Well the VOID would still exist!!   
Therefore EXISTENCE IS!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
I mean what would there be if there was non exixtence?   
There is no such thing as non being!   
One cannot even concieve of non exixstence.   
I dont mean the non existence of the material Universes ~~.   
............................................................   
And as consciousness is known to be.   
Then consciuosness is what IS!!   
Nothing could exist if there was not anything to be consciuos of it!   
Only consciuosness exists!~~

So   
If the previous two posts are true.   
Then.   
All that happens,   
All percieved events.   
All [whether real or not] Universes and beings living within the Universes.   
All these exist as a consequence of the Nature of reality.

1;All over the world people fight and kill each other for conflicting  
ideologies.   
Crazy ideas about the nature of God and the nature of reality.   
2;The computer with which we comunicate and the science tha created it are  
part of the investigation into the nature of physical reality.   
Surley it must be right to have concepts on the mental plane which get as near  
as is possible to the truth, rather than some of the ideas which are around  
,which are close to complete madness.   
The constant refining and updating of the mental and verbal ideas to get them  
closer to the Ultimate Truth must surely be a good thing? And might help  
others who follow the path. Isnt this just what all books on this subject do?   
Peace!!!

Books after all are views....ideologies are mine, yours and theirs...Baghvan  
was many times asked/ hinted why He is so quite when all of India was burning.  
His answer was always the same...improve our own attitude.   
Research into Religion, nature of God, heaven and hell has not made us any  
better. As on Dec 2006, the scientist are trying to solve BIG BANG. Concept  
is a thought. Imagine the whole world in deep sleep...then during that  
sleep....there is no world...a concept isn't it. So very temporary.   
I am who I am... all the refining and updating on mental plane leaves me

The post is ABOUT holding onto the perception of the world as a dream!!   
By realising that perception off the world is a picture manufactured by the  
mind out of cosciuossness.   
Thats why I started the post.   
I say to myself that is isnt real, that what Im seeing is an illusion. that  
the experiences that Ive had show me this.   
Otherwise I forget and start taking the ups and downs of material life  
seriously!!!   
And if I can get it into a more concise verbal form , or use a more modern  
metaphor it makes conversation with anyone else who is interested easier!!!!   
I talk for a living!!   
Peace, love and understanding

the truth is it takes energy to think thoughts, and silence requires no

Please correct me if Im wrong, but It seems to me that silence takes many  
,many lifetimes of effort and even with that effort it needs some grace too.   
Stetching around you the infinite Universe, living beings, seemingly without

Nor on this little planet, very very few have there ever ever been such as

I got this idea from repeatedly reading instructions to Sivarakasam Pillai.   
Why are things the way they are?   
If all that exists is ONE,   
If you divide ONE you get TWO,   
Divide again FOUR   
And again EIGHT.   
And so on.   
So this means that numbers and mathematics were NOT CREATED!!   
They are just a simple fact of the nature of reality!   
From this we might deduce that all of matter and the very existence of the  
Universe and all its laws are the same.   
No matter many universes there might be, no matter how many sub-atomic  
particles are found, they are ALL are result of the division of ONE. And the  
ONE is ALL!   
So all that exists is the nature of REALITY, uncreated, eternal unchanging and  
unchangeable!!

So   
If the previous two posts are true.   
Then.   
All that happens,   
All percieved events.   
All [whether real or not] Universes and beings living within the Universes.   
All these exist as a consequence of the Nature of reality.

1;All over the world people fight and kill each other for conflicting  
ideologies.   
Crazy ideas about the nature of God and the nature of reality.   
2;The computer with which we comunicate and the science tha created it are  
part of the investigation into the nature of physical reality.   
Surley it must be right to have concepts on the mental plane which get as near  
as is possible to the truth, rather than some of the ideas which are around  
,which are close to complete madness.   
The constant refining and updating of the mental and verbal ideas to get them  
closer to the Ultimate Truth must surely be a good thing? And might help  
others who follow the path. Isnt this just what all books on this subject do?   
Peace!!!

Books after all are views....ideologies are mine, yours and theirs...Baghvan  
was many times asked/ hinted why He is so quite when all of India was burning.  
His answer was always the same...improve our own attitude.   
Research into Religion, nature of God, heaven and hell has not made us any  
better. As on Dec 2006, the scientist are trying to solve BIG BANG. Concept  
is a thought. Imagine the whole world in deep sleep...then during that  
sleep....there is no world...a concept isn't it. So very temporary.   
I am who I am... all the refining and updating on mental plane leaves me  
stranded. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni was a refined man...well versed in all that  
books had to offer, yet he knew something was not right. And he got his  
answer.   
I can help a blind person to cross the road.... I surely cannot help if he  
blames the whole world for his darkness.   
I have to change my attitude...I have to unlearn and start all over  
again....and for this I need lot of LOVE and Faith... Bhakti...Devotion...

captmj   
I suggest you have a look at David Godmans book "Be as you are"   
You wil see that Ramana always answered sincere questions intelligently and  
lucidly.   
And he used metaphors from the modern world!! For instance his likening of the  
percieved world to the picture on a movie screen and saying that it is like  
the audience AND the actors being on the screen simultaneously !! Look at his  
replies to al the questions about the nature of things.   
You yourself are using thought to comunicate and are constantly forming  
concepts as you relate to material life.   
Everything has its place and what might loosely be called purpose.Without the  
process of conceptualisation you wouldnt know anything at all !!   
If you look at the world around you its possible to see, in a quite practical  
way that it is a picture WITHIN you. As Ramana said there is no inside and  
outside for the self. Certain psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD cause  
perception of the world to be distorted, making it plain that what we percieve  
to be the world is no more than a picture within us ! My one experience of  
Nirvikapala Samadhi and the Kundalini was in 1971 on LSD.   
So these statements that the world isnt real are actualy true!! In the sense  
that what we percieve as the world is, I qoute Ramana, "cordinated sense  
impressions",   
The picture of the world is created from cordinated sense impressions. The  
qualities that we experience, pleasant, bad, good, nice nasty, these are all  
the mind. Astral energy made from Sat Chit Ananda. The division [apparent ] of  
the Self into Duality gives rise to the mind and all its machinations. So I  
observe this within, in daily life. I recognise the process of mind as much as  
I am able.   
The mind is nescessary otherwise no forward progress is possible.   
Improve your attitude ? Knowing the truth at all levels possible IS improving  
your attitude!   
Peace   
Mick!!!

. ..Hello Mick   
There is no conflict...only varied interpretation. It used to happen right in  
front of Baghavan.   
Did I reject concepts...I dont think so. I am attempting to separate the ego I  
from the concepts...Yes I agree the world will be as long as there is  
impressions and concepts. Statements that world is untrue are statements...  
when the untruth is preceived, no statement will be necessary.   
To me Baghvan is silence...   
As Ramana says..mind turned inwards is pure and pure mind is Atma or truth  
...whatever the name is...   
And only by improving the attitude will lead me to truth at all levels or for  
that matter beyond levels..turiyattita.   
Till that time I need mind to improve my mind, material mind has to unlearn  
and turn within.   
Yours In Baghvan

Thats right. its what I meant.   
Varied interpretation, different interpretations suit different personalities.  
It must be a good thing if things can be seen to make sense!   
For me Ramana was/is the greatest guru of all time.   
Silence is hard to achieve.   
I get it that the I thought isnt the self, that if the I thought is a thought  
then there would seem to have to be an experiencer of the I thought. Also that  
this experiencer isnt real, it doesent exist. I sort of get it. I guess thats  
the limit of where the mind can go!   
But I do try!!

No Mick. ...havent seen the film...will when i get the chance.   
I am almost on a flight to Lagos and waiting at the lounge with Nan Yar in my  
pocket....well you started the thread and it was good. So here I am checking  
out what you had to say next...I am reading question 21 of the dialogue..   
Sivaprakasam Pillai : Is enquiry into scriptural teaching necessary for an  
earnest seeker ?   
Bagahvan : As there is no use in analysing the garbage collected, so it is  
with an earnest seeker who is searching for his-self,.There is no use for a  
person who wants to understand his -self, instead of discarding the ignorance  
that hides his- self, does research on his-self. This prapancham...crudely  
translated in English as "world " . .. ( for want of better description)  
should be perceived as a dream...   
Now then is it necessary for us to analyse nature of reality

1;All over the world people fight and kill each other for conflicting  
ideologies.   
Crazy ideas about the nature of God and the nature of reality.   
2;The computer with which we comunicate and the science tha created it are  
part of the investigation into the nature of physical reality.   
Surley it must be right to have concepts on the mental plane which get as near  
as is possible to the truth, rather than some of the ideas which are around  
,which are close to complete madness.   
The constant refining and updating of the mental and verbal ideas to get them  
closer to the Ultimate Truth must surely be a good thing? And might help  
others who follow the path. Isnt this just what all books on this subject do?

Books after all are views....ideologies are mine, yours and theirs...Baghvan  
was many times asked/ hinted why He is so quite when all of India was burning.  
His answer was always the same...improve our own attitude.   
Research into Religion, nature of God, heaven and hell has not made us any  
better. As on Dec 2006, the scientist are trying to solve BIG BANG. Concept  
is a thought. Imagine the whole world in deep sleep...then during that  
sleep....there is no world...a concept isn't it. So very temporary.   
I am who I am... all the refining and updating on mental plane leaves me  
stranded. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni was a refined man...well versed in all that  
books had to offer, yet he knew something was not right. And he got his  
answer.   
I can help a blind person to cross the road.... I surely cannot help if he

I suggest you have a look at David Godmans book "Be as you are"   
You wil see that Ramana always answered sincere questions intelligently and  
lucidly.   
And he used metaphors from the modern world!! For instance his likening of the  
percieved world to the picture on a movie screen and saying that it is like  
the audience AND the actors being on the screen simultaneously !! Look at his  
replies to al the questions about the nature of things.   
You yourself are using thought to comunicate and are constantly forming  
concepts as you relate to material life.   
Everything has its place and what might loosely be called purpose.Without the  
process of conceptualisation you wouldnt know anything at all !!   
If you look at the world around you its possible to see, in a quite practical  
way that it is a picture WITHIN you. As Ramana said there is no inside and  
outside for the self. Certain psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD cause  
perception of the world to be distorted, making it plain that what we percieve  
to be the world is no more than a picture within us ! My one experience of  
Nirvikapala Samadhi and the Kundalini was in 1971 on LSD.   
So these statements that the world isnt real are actualy true!! In the sense  
that what we percieve as the world is, I qoute Ramana, "cordinated sense  
impressions",   
The picture of the world is created from cordinated sense impressions. The  
qualities that we experience, pleasant, bad, good, nice nasty, these are all  
the mind. Astral energy made from Sat Chit Ananda. The division [apparent ] of  
the Self into Duality gives rise to the mind and all its machinations. So I  
observe this within, in daily life. I recognise the process of mind as much as  
I am able.   
The mind is nescessary otherwise no forward progress is possible.   
Improve your attitude ? Knowing the truth at all levels possible IS improving  
your attitude!   
Peace   
Mick!!!

. ..Hello Mick   
There is no conflict...only varied interpretation. It used to happen right in  
front of Baghavan.   
Did I reject concepts...I dont think so. I am attempting to separate the ego I  
from the concepts...Yes I agree the world will be as long as there is  
impressions and concepts. Statements that world is untrue are statements...  
when the untruth is preceived, no statement will be necessary.   
To me Baghvan is silence...   
As Ramana says..mind turned inwards is pure and pure mind is Atma or truth  
...whatever the name is...   
And only by improving the attitude will lead me to truth at all levels or for  
that matter beyond levels..turiyattita.   
Till that time I need mind to improve my mind, material mind has to unlearn  
and turn within.   
Yours In Baghvan

Thats right. its what I meant.   
Varied interpretation, different interpretations suit different personalities.  
It must be a good thing if things can be seen to make sense!   
For me Ramana was/is the greatest guru of all time.   
Silence is hard to achieve.   
I get it that the I thought isnt the self, that if the I thought is a thought  
then there would seem to have to be an experiencer of the I thought. Also that  
this experiencer isnt real, it doesent exist. I sort of get it. I guess thats  
the limit of where the mind can go!   
But I do try!!

No Mick. ...havent seen the film...will when i get the chance.   
I am almost on a flight to Lagos and waiting at the lounge with Nan Yar in my  
pocket....well you started the thread and it was good. So here I am checking  
out what you had to say next...I am reading question 21 of the dialogue..   
Sivaprakasam Pillai : Is enquiry into scriptural teaching necessary for an  
earnest seeker ?   
Bagahvan : As there is no use in analysing the garbage collected, so it is  
with an earnest seeker who is searching for his-self,.There is no use for a  
person who wants to understand his -self, instead of discarding the ignorance  
that hides his- self, does research on his-self. This prapancham...crudely  
translated in English as "world " . .. ( for want of better description)  
should be perceived as a dream...   
Now then is it necessary for us to analyse nature of reality   
Swami Dayananda in his commentary on Upadesa Saram says...thoughts are of 2  
types. ..mechanical and purposeful....   
mechanical thoughts are destructive. ...so lets avoid mechanical thoughts....a  
mind over which there is no control is a monkey...   
In Baghvan

The post is ABOUT holding onto the perception of the world as a dream!!   
By realising that perception off the world is a picture manufactured by the  
mind out of cosciuossness.   
Thats why I started the post.   
I say to myself that is isnt real, that what Im seeing is an illusion. that  
the experiences that Ive had show me this.   
Otherwise I forget and start taking the ups and downs of material life  
seriously!!!   
And if I can get it into a more concise verbal form , or use a more modern  
metaphor it makes conversation with anyone else who is interested easier!!!!   
I talk for a living!!   
Peace, love and understanding

silence is hard to achieve. ... mick   
the truth is it takes energy to think thoughts, and silence requires no  
energy at all.   
if what you want is truth, you will not find it in reason. following  
thoughts leads away from truth.

Tell me did you think when you repllied to the post?   
How can there be a discusion forum without thoughts?   
Silence takes no enegy for Who?   
Strange how people here, instead of discusng the topic give wise advice. I  
wonder what is the cause of this?   
Be careful that you do not make a dogma out of what should be an honest quest  
.That is the way of religion, and look at all the trouble that causes!

AND   
Please correct me if Im wrong, but It seems to me that silence takes many  
,many lifetimes of effort and even with that effort it needs some grace too.   
Stetching around you the infinite Universe, living beings, seemingly without  
end and not many of them are Silent.   
Nor on this little planet, very very few have there ever ever been such as  
Ramana Mahirishi! Silence no effort for this great and compassionate being  
,but for a lowly being such as I its a big effort!!!!!!!

I got this idea from repeatedly reading instructions to Sivarakasam Pillai.   
Why are things the way they are?   
If all that exists is ONE,   
If you divide ONE you get TWO,   
Divide again FOUR   
And again EIGHT.   
And so on.   
So this means that numbers and mathematics were NOT CREATED!!   
They are just a simple fact of the nature of reality!   
From this we might deduce that all of matter and the very existence of the  
Universe and all its laws are the same.   
No matter many universes there might be, no matter how many sub-atomic  
particles are found, they are ALL are result of the division of ONE. And the  
ONE is ALL!   
So all that exists is the nature of REALITY, uncreated, eternal unchanging and  
unchangeable!!

ALSO   
Another concept which seems to explain existence.   
What would exixts if nithing at all existed?   
No stars no planets.   
No matter.   
No space.   
No time.   
A VOID, in which there was nothing.   
Well the VOID would still exist!!   
Therefore EXISTENCE IS!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
I mean what would there be if there was non exixtence?   
There is no such thing as non being!   
One cannot even concieve of non exixstence.   
I dont mean the non existence of the material Universes ~~.   
............................................................   
And as consciousness is known to be.   
Then consciuosness is what IS!!   
Nothing could exist if there was not anything to be consciuos of it!

There is no conflict...only varied interpretation. It used to happen right in  
front of Baghavan.   
Did I reject concepts...I dont think so. I am attempting to separate the ego I  
from the concepts...Yes I agree the world will be as long as there is  
impressions and concepts. Statements that world is untrue are statements...  
when the untruth is preceived, no statement will be necessary.   
To me Baghvan is silence...   
As Ramana says..mind turned inwards is pure and pure mind is Atma or truth  
...whatever the name is...   
And only by improving the attitude will lead me to truth at all levels or for  
that matter beyond levels..turiyattita.   
Till that time I need mind to improve my mind, material mind has to unlearn  
and turn within.   
Yours In Baghvan

Thats right. its what I meant.   
Varied interpretation, different interpretations suit different personalities.  
It must be a good thing if things can be seen to make sense!   
For me Ramana was/is the greatest guru of all time.   
Silence is hard to achieve.   
I get it that the I thought isnt the self, that if the I thought is a thought  
then there would seem to have to be an experiencer of the I thought. Also that  
this experiencer isnt real, it doesent exist. I sort of get it. I guess thats  
the limit of where the mind can go!   
But I do try!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding.

The post is ABOUT holding onto the perception of the world as a dream!!   
By realising that perception off the world is a picture manufactured by the  
mind out of cosciuossness.   
Thats why I started the post.   
I say to myself that is isnt real, that what Im seeing is an illusion. that  
the experiences that Ive had show me this.   
Otherwise I forget and start taking the ups and downs of material life  
seriously!!!   
And if I can get it into a more concise verbal form , or use a more modern

I talk for a living!!

AND   
Please correct me if Im wrong, but It seems to me that silence takes many  
,many lifetimes of effort and even with that effort it needs some grace too.   
Stetching around you the infinite Universe, living beings, seemingly without  
end and not many of them are Silent.   
Nor on this little planet, very very few have there ever ever been such as  
Ramana Mahirishi! Silence no effort for this great and compassionate being  
,but for a lowly being such as I its a big effort!!!!!!!

I got this idea from repeatedly reading instructions to Sivarakasam Pillai.   
Why are things the way they are?   
If all that exists is ONE,   
If you divide ONE you get TWO,   
Divide again FOUR   
And again EIGHT.   
And so on.   
So this means that numbers and mathematics were NOT CREATED!!   
They are just a simple fact of the nature of reality!   
From this we might deduce that all of matter and the very existence of the  
Universe and all its laws are the same.   
No matter many universes there might be, no matter how many sub-atomic  
particles are found, they are ALL are result of the division of ONE. And the  
ONE is ALL!   
So all that exists is the nature of REALITY, uncreated, eternal unchanging and  
unchangeable!!

ALSO   
Another concept which seems to explain existence.   
What would exixts if nithing at all existed?   
No stars no planets.   
No matter.   
No space.   
No time.   
A VOID, in which there was nothing.   
Well the VOID would still exist!!   
Therefore EXISTENCE IS!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
I mean what would there be if there was non exixtence?   
There is no such thing as non being!   
One cannot even concieve of non exixstence.   
I dont mean the non existence of the material Universes ~~.   
............................................................   
And as consciousness is known to be.   
Then consciuosness is what IS!!   
Nothing could exist if there was not anything to be consciuos of it!   
Only consciuosness exists!~~

So   
If the previous two posts are true.   
Then.   
All that happens,   
All percieved events.   
All [whether real or not] Universes and beings living within the Universes.   
All these exist as a consequence of the Nature of reality.

1;All over the world people fight and kill each other for conflicting  
ideologies.   
Crazy ideas about the nature of God and the nature of reality.   
2;The computer with which we comunicate and the science tha created it are  
part of the investigation into the nature of physical reality.   
Surley it must be right to have concepts on the mental plane which get as near  
as is possible to the truth, rather than some of the ideas which are around  
,which are close to complete madness.   
The constant refining and updating of the mental and verbal ideas to get them  
closer to the Ultimate Truth must surely be a good thing? And might help  
others who follow the path. Isnt this just what all books on this subject do?   
Peace!!!

Books after all are views....ideologies are mine, yours and theirs...Baghvan  
was many times asked/ hinted why He is so quite when all of India was burning.  
His answer was always the same...improve our own attitude.   
Research into Religion, nature of God, heaven and hell has not made us any  
better. As on Dec 2006, the scientist are trying to solve BIG BANG. Concept  
is a thought. Imagine the whole world in deep sleep...then during that  
sleep....there is no world...a concept isn't it. So very temporary.   
I am who I am... all the refining and updating on mental plane leaves me  
stranded. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni was a refined man...well versed in all that  
books had to offer, yet he knew something was not right. And he got his  
answer.   
I can help a blind person to cross the road.... I surely cannot help if he  
blames the whole world for his darkness.   
I have to change my attitude...I have to unlearn and start all over  
again....and for this I need lot of LOVE and Faith... Bhakti...Devotion...

captmj   
I suggest you have a look at David Godmans book "Be as you are"   
You wil see that Ramana always answered sincere questions intelligently and  
lucidly.   
And he used metaphors from the modern world!! For instance his likening of the  
percieved world to the picture on a movie screen and saying that it is like  
the audience AND the actors being on the screen simultaneously !! Look at his  
replies to al the questions about the nature of things.   
You yourself are using thought to comunicate and are constantly forming  
concepts as you relate to material life.   
Everything has its place and what might loosely be called purpose.Without the  
process of conceptualisation you wouldnt know anything at all !!   
If you look at the world around you its possible to see, in a quite practical  
way that it is a picture WITHIN you. As Ramana said there is no inside and  
outside for the self. Certain psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD cause  
perception of the world to be distorted, making it plain that what we percieve  
to be the world is no more than a picture within us ! My one experience of  
Nirvikapala Samadhi and the Kundalini was in 1971 on LSD.   
So these statements that the world isnt real are actualy true!! In the sense  
that what we percieve as the world is, I qoute Ramana, "cordinated sense  
impressions",   
The picture of the world is created from cordinated sense impressions. The  
qualities that we experience, pleasant, bad, good, nice nasty, these are all  
the mind. Astral energy made from Sat Chit Ananda. The division [apparent ] of  
the Self into Duality gives rise to the mind and all its machinations. So I  
observe this within, in daily life. I recognise the process of mind as much as  
I am able.   
The mind is nescessary otherwise no forward progress is possible.   
Improve your attitude ? Knowing the truth at all levels possible IS improving  
your attitude!   
Peace   
Mick!!!

AND   
Please correct me if Im wrong, but It seems to me that silence takes many  
,many lifetimes of effort and even with that effort it needs some grace too.   
Stetching around you the infinite Universe, living beings, seemingly without  
end and not many of them are Silent.   
Nor on this little planet, very very few have there ever ever been such as  
Ramana Mahirishi! Silence no effort for this great and compassionate being  
,but for a lowly being such as I its a big effort!!!!!!!

when you realize that who you think you are is only a story, everything falls  
into place.   
as long as you are searching for something, you are overlooking the truth  
that is already here.

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

ALSO   
I notice that when someone went to Ramana with a philosohical question, like"  
why would God will this way? " Ramana ANSWERS THE QUESTION!!!. He doesnt make  
comments about the questioners LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT. Ramana  
does his best to answer the question.   
He doesnt see himself as some superior being looking down on the questioner.   
This is the real thing !!!!100% enlighened being, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   
No trying to get followers.   
No feeling of superiority.

What Im saying is ALL IS ONE. If ALL = one then if you divide ONE you get

human mind they are the result of the division of ONE. All of the percieved  
Universe and everything that IS, is as a result of this [apparent] division  
.The human mind itself exists as a result of the divisoin of ONE. All that  
exists is ONE. Existence itself cannot be dual. For this reason all that  
exists is the result of divsion!   
The SELF is SAT CHIT ANANDA. Divide it you get the Duality of subject and  
object. You get the Ego which percieves the Object [not really real though]  
and you get the objects percieved. The percieved qualities of the object the  
,ASTRAL aspect, result from the ANANDA aspect of the SELF.   
The EGO or imaginary "I", results from the Chit aspect of the SELF. When the  
duality ceases in SAMADHI The SELF is revealed as being only ONE.   
Everything fits together, everything is logical, everything makes sense.   
And ALL that exists is CONSCIUOSNESS   
And CONSCIUOSNESS is only ONE!

What requirement does is'ness have for the words "ALL" and "ONE" except for  
the processing of thoughts which simply binds oneself from recognising the  
thought's source, that which IS...   
Perhaps one should focus their attention on the meaning of ALL aswell as  
ONENESS. ALL is infinity, this is why i asked earlier, _how can you divide  
infinity?_ All divisions are created by mathmatical concepts of the mind.

Originally there was Void. (Before void, what was there? We   
do not know. Some play like the one, which I am describing was   
there ). Then the Brahman or God or Shiva breathed out.   
Came the universe. When the play is over, the Brahman or God   
or Shiva, would breath in and everything will go away leaving   
Void. Buddha said there is only Void, Mahasunya. Shankara said,   
it is Sat-Chit-Ananda, the Existence-Knowledge-Bliss. Bhagavan has   
said that after the play is over, only the Screen remains. Screen is   
there, before, during and after the play. Saiva Siddhantists call it: Siva-Oli and Parai-Natham - the Effulgence of Shiva and Sound of   
the anklets of dancing Kali.

Hi nonduel,   
The conclusion you have got to is absolutly correct.   
I have gone through this few days back while doing meditation.It was great  
fealing which cant be expressed.

Noduel,   
The only thing I would disagree with you on, it is not to "prevent" thoughts,  
it is only to quiet the mind in having thoughts so self can be realized.   
ashwin   
1) If time is realized mind is here.   
I spend no time meditating. Vigilance dictates only this moment.   
But self is still waiting for mind to be quiet as of yet. I still go in and  
out of resistance   
2) I read Who am I? Those words pointed the way.   
Have I had a personal experience? Who is this person having an experience?   
Only me.

Nonduel,   
Indeed. words get in the way sometimes for me. We speak the same thought.   
Intention can get lost in the words we choose to use. I just wanted to be  
clear cause I tried resisting for many years what I was thinking and feeling  
and it is just more mind games.   
 I find it very difficult to write about nonduality, but it is vigilance for  
me to do so. And I love it.   
That is wonderful you are aware of self when involved in activites.   
As of yet I still fall back into mind when engaged in worldly activites   
 But I am becoming aware of the answear when asking the question "Who am I" or  
especially "who is having this thought"repeatedly.   
Nobody but me.   
I like that

Nonduel, your method of practice is correct. When thoughts   
gush forth, you should kill them as you kill the soldiers from the   
fort of the enemy. If all the soldiers are vanquished, the fort   
is in your hands. First, one can keep the eyes closed and be without   
thoughts. Closing the eyes, while doing office or other work, will   
not be possible but by practice, this becomes possible. As Bhagavan   
says towards the end of Who am I?, if 'i' rises, everything 'rises'.   
If 'i' subsides, everything subsides. To the extent, one is humble, it   
is good. When one controls the mind, one can be anywhere, be it   
office or home. In my case, thoughts keep on gushing forth, and   
I try to cling one thought of Arunachala-Siva, like an elephant holding   
on its trunk, an iron chain. This happens from the time I get up till   
I sleep.

Author: mick hutchinson     Date: January 29, 2007, 11:54:18 AM

There is a Hindhu doctrine which states that cause and effect do not exist.   
How can this be true when everything that we percieve is subject to the laws  
of cause and effect?   
I think the answer to this one is simple.   
For instance, take the life of one person.   
First there is the baby, then the child the adult, old age and then death   
The child did not cause the adult, nor the adult cause the old age or death.   
They are all merely stages in the developement of the same entity!   
OR   
A railway line.   
As we travel along the line events appear to pass by but really the events are  
fixed and we merely pass along the line!   
The beginning and end of the line always exist.   
The motion of the train along the line represents the apparent passage of  
time.   
The line is eternal.   
The train/ego appears to move along the line.   
I reckon that everything makes sense, everything fits into a logical pattern  
if we can but see it.   
And everthing has the possibility of being understood apart from I AM, which  
is single and cannot be touched by the mind!

Also I think that Astro Mental refers to that plane of existence where  
,Leprechauns, Fairies, or whatever they are exist. Some sort of disembodied  
minds. When aked if they exist, Ramana said they do. When asked where they are  
he replied " In you".   
Some people have had some experience of this area of the mind under the  
infuence of psychedelic drugs.   
 And very strange it is too!   
Definately not to be played with is the occult!!   
Has an astral quality which reminds one of the smell of sulphur!

Yes, I'm familiar with him, The point I was making was that talk about astral  
planes and so forth are a bunch of Theosophical doctrine that I find  
questionable, and have no need of. Mouni Sadhu, man I haven't heard that name  
in 25 years! I read his "In Days of Great Peace" when I was in high school.  
I think it was my introduction to Ramana and Sri Aurobindo. I was trying to  
remember his name a few months ago, and just couldn't do it. Thanks.   
Speaking of people with ties to Theosophy, what are your thoughts on  
Krishnamurti? I realize he hasn't been dead 50 years, but he never claimed to  
be a guru, so I suppose discussing him is alright.   
Also, have you read The Sufis by Idries Shah?

" What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS."   
What Einstein meant by relativity theory was that time and space are not  
absolutes, but ARE relative to the viewpoint of the observer. And, yes, you  
could say that light doesn't travel at all. From it's own perspective, there  
is no distance traveled, and no time passed. In a very real sense, you could  
say that it is defining distance and time. There are aspects of this that are  
unbelievably bizarre, but it would take up too much space to go into them  
here.   
One weird thing, though, is how light travels. You mentioned the key fact.  
Regardless of the movement of an object, light still moves away from it at the  
same speed. Because there is no such thing as absolute space, no absolute  
framework of space and time. We can only say objects are moving or at rest  
compared to a particular frame of reference. For instance, say an asteroid and  
the earth are on a collision course. From our frame of reference, we are at  
rest, and the asteroid is moving towards us. From the asteroids, it is at rest  
and we are moving towards it. Light does not discriminate. It merely describes  
the distance between the two objects by the time it takes to travel between  
the two, and describes the rate at which this distance is decreasing by  
shifting towards the blue end of the spectrum. Light from both objects will  
appear to have the same blue shift when observed from the other. If objects  
are moving away from each other, light shifts toward the red end of the  
spectrum.

BTW, Physicists are working very hard on a general theory to supplant  
relativity and quantum mechanics, each of which only describe things under  
different circumstances, but contradict each other in their separate spheres.  
So a Theory of Everything is needed, (TOE for short) which can describe  
everything, without having to refer to one theory under certain circumstances,  
and the other to describe events under different ones. The two major  
candidates are loop quantum gravity and string theory, but both are still very  
incomplete, and extremely complicated. And the observation that the expansion  
of the universe is speeding up instead of slowing down has further complicated  
matters. Personally, I think the final theory will incorporate parts of all  
these theories, plus consciousness. When we finally find it, I think it will  
be responsible for a quantum leap in the evolution of the consciousness of  
mankind. Which is why I consider it so important.

What do we mean by real? Think about this, because language has caused us to  
accept this term without fully identifying what we mean by it.   
Let us look at some other points first, before we go further into this. (I  
wish I had more time to go into this, because one could easily write a book on  
this subject, and still not cover all the implications.)   
When we look at an object, what occurs? Light reflecting from the object  
strikes the eyes and cause a signal to be sent to the brain, whch creates the  
image of that object. We perceive the object as having a certain color. But is  
this color intrinsic to the object, or is it the creation of the interaction  
between consciousness and the physical brain? Science tells us that what we  
perceive as color is a wavelength of visible light. So, the only information  
that the lightwave is carrying is it's wavelength and frequency of vibration.  
There is nothing intrinsically 'red' or 'blue' about this information.   
When we touch an object, it seems solid to us. But physics tells us that if  
we go down to the subatomic level, there is nothing solid there. Only the  
mutually repulsive force of what we call electrons keeps us from falling  
through the floor. And the subatomic particles themselves? They seem to have  
no independent existence, but exist only as an inter-relationship with  
everything else. In isolation, they exist only as probabilities of  
interaction.   
 But probabilities, like consciousness, are not a physical thing. Yet both  
seem to be the basis that the physical universe is built upon.   
 So is the universe dependent upon the consciousness of the individual?  
Apparently not, though you could build a case that since everyone's entire  
knowledge of the universe is based upon your individual consciousness, it  
would be far easier to defend this viewpoint than the independent existence of  
the universe. But it seems far more likely that the universe exists within  
the universal consciousness which we are all a part of.   
 So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space.

Lsd and other true psychedelic drugs cause the image of the world to change

Probabilities ? If as they say its all predetermined, then maybe its all like

page 106, chapterXVIII Self-realisation, instructions to F H Humphries. By B  
V NARASIMHA SWAMI. The quote goes.......   
Salutations to the feet of the guru Sri Dakshinamurti, who sees within himself  
the entire Universe, which resembles the image of a city in a mirror. Which  
appears to be outside of him just as objects seen in a dream are outside the  
dreamer, but which merges into himself in the state of realisation-for then he  
sees the self alone and not the objects he dreamt of."   
Its seems that the Cosmic mind has the Universe within it independant of sense  
impressiions   
This book seems to have been signed by Ramana Mahrishi himself!!!!! Its from  
the ashram in the 1930s!!!

"Material universe has got substance outside the mind of   
the observer". It is okay. But is it true? Sanskrit employs   
two words, Satya and Mithya, the Real and the seemingly   
real. Material universe is continued to be observed by "other   
observers", even after I die. Imagaine a situtation, when all   
human beings in this world die simultaneously in some inter-   
galactic war, will the material universe be there still? If so,   
for whom? Hence, it is only for the observer, that universe is   
real, or relatively real and no universe exists apart from the   
observer. Bhagavan says," that the Real is only Swarupa. The   
jagat (world or universe), jeeva (the soul or individual, the single   
I) and Eswara (God outside) are all imaginations, like silver   
in the oyster shell. Jagat is I-I, jeeva is I-I and Eawara is I-I.   
 All are Shiva, the I-I." (Who am I?).   
Further Roger Penrose, Richard Feynaman, Stephen Hawking (?) says that if you  
become smaller than a subatomic particle, you can walk through the wall! This  
has in fact, been done by some Saiva Siddhantis!

Subramanian.R   
What I was trying to say is.   
Most definately what we experience as " The World " is actually a picture  
within us manufactured by the mind from sense impressions.   
Sensory information travels up the nerves to the brain where, i Quote Ramana "  
It gets cordinated ". So it's like the mind creates the world from a synthesis  
of sense impresions, Which are interpreted by the mind using archetypes.   
Fixed modes pf thought. Friend, enemy, atractive, repulsive, dangerous, are  
all archetypes. What is always so amazing about Ramana is how he gets so much  
into so few words. The book "Who am I "sums up the whole mind succinctly and  
perfectly.   
However   
He did admit that the material world is real somewhere in David Godmans book  
,I think that he always directed people to self inquiry not to questions about  
the reallity of the world. However I think that what we believe is the world  
is a construct of the mind as he said but I think that there is some sort of  
existence coresponding to the material world it's just that all we know of it  
is from a picture within us contructed by the mind which isn't real in the  
same way that a picture on a TV screen isn't the world that it depicts.   
Until Self Realisation you have to deal with the world as it comes

Dear mick, I quite agree with you. What I was trying to explain   
is that Sankara, in order to satisfy the "world is real" dualists, said   
that the world is "real" but only "seemingly real" (mithya), till one   
is realized, where after this will also disappear. Bhagavan   
also said that when a film-negative is exposed to the sun, it will   
not take any other image. If one is self-realized (that is exposed   
to the Sun of suns, Brahman), he will not gather any other image. The   
Seer becomes the Screen! In this context, some astro-physicsts   
believe that there is no one universe, but a di-verse, and every thing   
that happens in this universe, is happening in the same point of time   
and space in the di-verse also! Bhagavan has also said that " He lives   
simulataneously in twenty lokas and is doing the same thing!" When   
someone asked, "whether Indraloka, Chandraloka, Kailasa and Vaikunta   
\-- are all real?" Bhagavan said, "Yes, as you are all sitting before me,   
some others are also sitting before someone there!" Arunachala-Siva.

What I reckon is...   
What we experience as the body, is a picture of the body which is manufactured  
out of consciuosness by the mind.   
So the answer to the question is both yes and no!   
If the body was ONLY the creation of the mind of the individual, then it  
woild dissapear when it dies.   
This does not happen! Others can observe the continued existence of the body  
when the spirit no longer is connected to it.   
However the picture of the body disapears from the spirit upon death.   
Therefore the reality of the body is similar to the reality of the picure on a  
TV screen. The picture is not the reality that it is a picture of.   
There are ways pf proving this more or less conclisively! But unfortuneately  
they are mostli illegal.

What do we mean by real? Think about this, because language has caused us to  
accept this term without fully identifying what we mean by it.   
Let us look at some other points first, before we go further into this. (I  
wish I had more time to go into this, because one could easily write a book on  
this subject, and still not cover all the implications.)   
When we look at an object, what occurs? Light reflecting from the object  
strikes the eyes and cause a signal to be sent to the brain, whch creates the  
image of that object. We perceive the object as having a certain color. But is  
this color intrinsic to the object, or is it the creation of the interaction  
between consciousness and the physical brain? Science tells us that what we  
perceive as color is a wavelength of visible light. So, the only information  
that the lightwave is carrying is it's wavelength and frequency of vibration.  
There is nothing intrinsically 'red' or 'blue' about this information.   
When we touch an object, it seems solid to us. But physics tells us that if  
we go down to the subatomic level, there is nothing solid there. Only the  
mutually repulsive force of what we call electrons keeps us from falling  
through the floor. And the subatomic particles themselves? They seem to have  
no independent existence, but exist only as an inter-relationship with  
everything else. In isolation, they exist only as probabilities of  
interaction.   
 But probabilities, like consciousness, are not a physical thing. Yet both  
seem to be the basis that the physical universe is built upon.   
 So is the universe dependent upon the consciousness of the individual?  
Apparently not, though you could build a case that since everyone's entire  
knowledge of the universe is based upon your individual consciousness, it  
would be far easier to defend this viewpoint than the independent existence of  
the universe. But it seems far more likely that the universe exists within  
the universal consciousness which we are all a part of.   
 So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space.

Yes thats more or less what I think too.   
What we percieve as colour is actuly divsion of consciuousness. The mind  
creating the experience of colour out of consciousness.   
What I was trying to get at was this issue of independant existence.   
Lsd and other true psychedelic drugs cause the image of the world to change  
and distort. But no other person perceieves this. Also after death other  
people percieve the decay of the body. These two things must lead us the  
conclusion that the material Universe has some sort of existence outside the  
mind of the observer! And we all to some extent percieve the same objects.   
So, i think you are right, it is the Universal mind. The ultimate stuff of  
the universe is consciousness. Subatomic particles and quasars, all the  
galaxies, all Universes..   
Probabilities ? If as they say its all predetermined, then maybe its all like  
a cosmic DVD playing, within the Universal mind.   
Like when you watch a movie there apear to be events, and cause and effect

"Material universe has got substance outside the mind of   
the observer". It is okay. But is it true? Sanskrit employs   
two words, Satya and Mithya, the Real and the seemingly   
real. Material universe is continued to be observed by "other   
observers", even after I die. Imagaine a situtation, when all   
human beings in this world die simultaneously in some inter-   
galactic war, will the material universe be there still? If so,   
for whom? Hence, it is only for the observer, that universe is   
real, or relatively real and no universe exists apart from the   
observer. Bhagavan says," that the Real is only Swarupa. The   
jagat (world or universe), jeeva (the soul or individual, the single   
I) and Eswara (God outside) are all imaginations, like silver   
in the oyster shell. Jagat is I-I, jeeva is I-I and Eawara is I-I.   
 All are Shiva, the I-I." (Who am I?).   
Further Roger Penrose, Richard Feynaman, Stephen Hawking (?) says that if you  
become smaller than a subatomic particle, you can walk through the wall! This  
has in fact, been done by some Saiva Siddhantis!

Subramanian.R   
What I was trying to say is.   
Most definately what we experience as " The World " is actually a picture  
within us manufactured by the mind from sense impressions.   
Sensory information travels up the nerves to the brain where, i Quote Ramana "  
It gets cordinated ". So it's like the mind creates the world from a synthesis  
of sense impresions, Which are interpreted by the mind using archetypes.   
Fixed modes pf thought. Friend, enemy, atractive, repulsive, dangerous, are  
all archetypes. What is always so amazing about Ramana is how he gets so much  
into so few words. The book "Who am I "sums up the whole mind succinctly and  
perfectly.   
However   
He did admit that the material world is real somewhere in David Godmans book  
,I think that he always directed people to self inquiry not to questions about  
the reallity of the world. However I think that what we believe is the world  
is a construct of the mind as he said but I think that there is some sort of  
existence coresponding to the material world it's just that all we know of it  
is from a picture within us contructed by the mind which isn't real in the  
same way that a picture on a TV screen isn't the world that it depicts.   
Until Self Realisation you have to deal with the world as it comes

Dear mick, I quite agree with you. What I was trying to explain   
is that Sankara, in order to satisfy the "world is real" dualists, said   
that the world is "real" but only "seemingly real" (mithya), till one   
is realized, where after this will also disappear. Bhagavan   
also said that when a film-negative is exposed to the sun, it will   
not take any other image. If one is self-realized (that is exposed   
to the Sun of suns, Brahman), he will not gather any other image. The   
Seer becomes the Screen! In this context, some astro-physicsts   
believe that there is no one universe, but a di-verse, and every thing   
that happens in this universe, is happening in the same point of time   
and space in the di-verse also! Bhagavan has also said that " He lives   
simulataneously in twenty lokas and is doing the same thing!" When   
someone asked, "whether Indraloka, Chandraloka, Kailasa and Vaikunta   
\-- are all real?" Bhagavan said, "Yes, as you are all sitting before me,

Once Bhagawan is sitting near Virupaksha cave and a group of Sadhus are  
sitting in front of him silently with reverance.One Sadhu with big belly came  
there   
but is quite uncomfortable with the way people giving importance to Bhagawan  
and he selected a seat much higher than Bhagawan and declared that he is   
greater than Bhagawan because he sat at a higher level than Bhagawan and  
insisted that other sahus must adore him.Sadhus are surprised at his behaviour   
but Bhagawan remained without any reaction.After some time one monkey came and  
occupied a comfortable position on a tree much higher than everybody.   
Now Bhagawan declared now that a monkey is occupying a higher position than  
all of us including that big belly Swami it must be greater than all of us   
according to the statement of the Swami let us all adore that monkey.Everybody  
laughed wholeheartedly except that big belly swami who went away ashamed.

Dear Raju, Many sadhus in the Hills had tried many pranks   
some even dangerous pranks, like rolling down a rock upon Bhagavan,   
have been tried. Bhagavan kept his normal Silence in these matters.   
These 'sadhus' have been vividly described in Tamil, Ramana   
Vijayam. Bhagavan often used to say, that there is no 'ajnani',   
there is no 'jnani', but there is only Jnana!

Bhagawan jokularly said it is swayambhu linga because it is coming up by

One day Bhagawan is walking on Arunachala hill.Three learned people came near  
him and asked Bhagawan "what is meant by Akarma even when one is engaged   
in work".Bhagawan did not reply but took a stem of a moderate sized plant and  
started making it into a staff with the help of leaves there.It took one and  
half hours   
to prepare and give finishing touches to that staff and to the surprise of  
questioners the staff is extremely beautiful.By the time it is finished one  
shepard boy   
came there and saluted Bhagawan and asked about his welfare.Bhagawan gave that  
beauiful staff to that boy saying that it will be useful to hiim but he did  
not   
answer to the question of the learned people and went upwards.The learned  
people understood the existential message of action wihout doership without   
an eye on the fruit of action and went happily.

Dear Raju, Yes. Bhagavan demonstrated what is Nishkamya   
Karma or Naishkarmya Karma or Akarma, to the questioner.   
Bhagavan used to prepare nice curries, sambhar and rice by   
toiling for a couple of hours with kitchen workers. But at   
the lunch, He used to mix everything and took them as one   
lump, without bothering about taste!

As Sri Bhagavan says: Ishvar-arpitam na ichaya kritam chitta shodakam mukti  
marganam   
[Having surrendered to God, not desiring anything, just reveling in the Self  
is the way to Liberation.]   
Actually people pick this up as a practise. That is not the way to do.   
One needs to understand a few things: a) We have a right to work, over result we do not have any control.   
So once someone understands this, one cannot strongly hold to the results.   
b) There is no Doer. .. only IShvara. So, Reveling in Self, Reveling in  
Ishvara is also not a "Task". .. it is an understanding. .. when properly  
understood, it automatically shows off in the actions as in the case of Sri  
Ramana in this story.

Dear Subramanian,   
 Desire for self is also a desire because like other desires it is an outcome of self-ignorance.But desire for self finally leads   
to self-enquiry and is consumed in the fire of self-knowledge that is  
conferred during enquiry,so i welcome that desire.Desire for self happens  
because of God's grace.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
 That is the only desire.   
There is fundamental ignorance: I am incomplete.   
And Therefore a desire: I should become Complete.   
all desires are desires for completeness. So every one who seeks, what ever he  
seeks, is seeking completeness.   
When the object he seeks itself does not have that completeness. .. he is  
seeking at the wrong place. Hence he is called a materialist!   
When the object he seeks is a spiritual experience which can lead him out of  
incompleteness we call him a spiritual seeker.   
When he understands that the very seeking is born out of wrong knowledge. The  
seeking stops and so does the seeker and The Self Shines in full.   
Love!

Dear Ramanaduli, Yes. Tirumoolar said: You cut the desires   
all the desires, even your desire with the Self or God. He has   
advocated desisrelessness towards the Self also. But let us hear   
the others. And then work out the final answer. Once Visvanathaswami's  
brother who was a Gandhian and a freedom   
fighter came to the Asram. He had no faith in castes etc., Despite   
being a Brahmin, he deliberately sat in a non brahmin's row for   
meals. Bhagavan said that even the desirelessness to sit in   
a brahmin's row for meals is also a desire! The Self is beyond   
the desires and non desires! What do you say for this?

Dear Subrahmaniyanji   
After realaising the Self, all works, speech comes normal way. in natural way.  
So Bhagavan got realaisation and   
the SELF was moving, talking even though it had a human frame. There is no  
desire or any intention to show off.   
But without self realisation whatever people do there must be some ego touch.  
People may become slaves to their behaviour, symbols and robes. Bhagavan must  
have realised the gentleman who sat in non brahmin's row. He wanted to show  
himself that he does not believe in cast system. I think politics and  
spiritualism cannot go along. We are all ordinary atma. Karam Chand Gandhi was  
mahatma due to his selveless desire towards to one country i.e. India. Whereas  
Bhagavan is paramatma for the 14 lokhas. My mother used to advise me, even if  
you know something you must have the bowyam specially in front of mahans. All  
are Bhagavans Leelas. That much I can say.

The profound point to understand is... For none of the activities do we need

On the subject of non-doership, I shall give a quote from Annamalai   
Swami -Final Talks: Once a questioner asked: The desire to become absorbed in the Self, seems to be some kind   
of vasana. It is still a desire, and to indulge in it implies that I must   
look for something I do not already have. With this attitude, I then   
feel that I am setting up enlghtenment as some kind of a future goal,   
and not something that is here and now. There is something very   
dualistic in this attitude, and I sometimes get the feeling that I am   
not accepting Bhagavan's will for the present moment if I am looking   
for something that is not here and now.   
Annamalai Swami: This desire is not counter productive. The desire for enlightenment   
is necessary because without it, you live never the necessary steps   
to realize the Self. A desire to walk to a particular place is necessary   
before, you take any steps. If that desire is not present, you will   
never take up the first step. When you realize the Self, that desire   
will go.   
Here again, it is only "the desire for enlightenment" that is, the process,   
and not the Self, which is the goal. I still feel that Bhagavan had   
mentioned anything directly like the desire for the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

In one way you are correct. we need not to do anything. But when? When I

Dear Ramanaduli,   
The ignorance is alone is the villain of the peace. Ignorance or   
ajnana is one which makes us to have desires for worldly things,   
do things with ego and get feelings like pain and pleasure, happiness   
and misery, good and bad. Ignorance is like darkness and the   
mere presence of Knowledge removes the darkness. The   
sun or lamp should be "merely" present and it does not eradicate   
the darkenss; the darkness merely disappears.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
The ignorance is alone is the villain of the peace. Ignorance or   
ajnana is one which makes us to have desires for worldly things,   
do things with ego and get feelings like pain and pleasure, happiness   
and misery, good and bad. Ignorance is like darkness and the   
mere presence of Knowledge removes the darkness. The   
sun or lamp should be "merely" present and it does not eradicate   
the darkenss; the darkness merely disappears.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 It is really nice to see that you are visiting Swami Suddhananda ji's site. .. IF possible go and meet him in person and elaborately discuss these things. He is a Realized Soul. Just by exposing yourself to this teaching, ignorance is dispelled and Self is Seen.

## Re:[0]No cause and effect?  
Author: mick hutchinson     Date: January 29, 2007, 11:54:18 AM  
---  
There is a Hindhu doctrine which states that cause and effect do not exist.   
How can this be true when everything that we percieve is subject to the laws  
of cause and effect?   
I think the answer to this one is simple.   
For instance, take the life of one person.   
First there is the baby, then the child the adult, old age and then death   
The child did not cause the adult, nor the adult cause the old age or death.   
They are all merely stages in the developement of the same entity!   
OR   
A railway line.   
As we travel along the line events appear to pass by but really the events are  
fixed and we merely pass along the line!   
The beginning and end of the line always exist.   
The motion of the train along the line represents the apparent passage of  
time.   
The line is eternal.   
The train/ego appears to move along the line.   
I reckon that everything makes sense, everything fits into a logical pattern  
if we can but see it.   
And everthing has the possibility of being understood apart from I AM, which  
is single and cannot be touched by the mind!

Author: mick hutchinson     Date: January 29, 2007, 11:03:05 AM

What I reckon is...   
What we experience as the body, is a picture of the body which is manufactured  
out of consciuosness by the mind.   
So the answer to the question is both yes and no!   
If the body was ONLY the creation of the mind of the individual, then it  
woild dissapear when it dies.   
This does not happen! Others can observe the continued existence of the body  
when the spirit no longer is connected to it.   
However the picture of the body disapears from the spirit upon death.   
Therefore the reality of the body is similar to the reality of the picure on a  
TV screen. The picture is not the reality that it is a picture of.   
There are ways pf proving this more or less conclisively! But unfortuneately  
they are mostli illegal.

What do we mean by real? Think about this, because language has caused us to  
accept this term without fully identifying what we mean by it.   
Let us look at some other points first, before we go further into this. (I  
wish I had more time to go into this, because one could easily write a book on  
this subject, and still not cover all the implications.)   
When we look at an object, what occurs? Light reflecting from the object  
strikes the eyes and cause a signal to be sent to the brain, whch creates the  
image of that object. We perceive the object as having a certain color. But is  
this color intrinsic to the object, or is it the creation of the interaction  
between consciousness and the physical brain? Science tells us that what we  
perceive as color is a wavelength of visible light. So, the only information  
that the lightwave is carrying is it's wavelength and frequency of vibration.  
There is nothing intrinsically 'red' or 'blue' about this information.   
When we touch an object, it seems solid to us. But physics tells us that if  
we go down to the subatomic level, there is nothing solid there. Only the  
mutually repulsive force of what we call electrons keeps us from falling  
through the floor. And the subatomic particles themselves? They seem to have  
no independent existence, but exist only as an inter-relationship with  
everything else. In isolation, they exist only as probabilities of  
interaction.   
 But probabilities, like consciousness, are not a physical thing. Yet both  
seem to be the basis that the physical universe is built upon.   
 So is the universe dependent upon the consciousness of the individual?  
Apparently not, though you could build a case that since everyone's entire  
knowledge of the universe is based upon your individual consciousness, it  
would be far easier to defend this viewpoint than the independent existence of  
the universe. But it seems far more likely that the universe exists within  
the universal consciousness which we are all a part of.   
 So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space.

Yes thats more or less what I think too.   
What we percieve as colour is actuly divsion of consciuousness. The mind  
creating the experience of colour out of consciousness.   
What I was trying to get at was this issue of independant existence.   
Lsd and other true psychedelic drugs cause the image of the world to change  
and distort. But no other person perceieves this. Also after death other  
people percieve the decay of the body. These two things must lead us the  
conclusion that the material Universe has some sort of existence outside the  
mind of the observer! And we all to some extent percieve the same objects.   
So, i think you are right, it is the Universal mind. The ultimate stuff of  
the universe is consciousness. Subatomic particles and quasars, all the  
galaxies, all Universes..   
Probabilities ? If as they say its all predetermined, then maybe its all like  
a cosmic DVD playing, within the Universal mind.   
Like when you watch a movie there apear to be events, and cause and effect  
,but really its all just the one thing and the laser [ the moment NOW ] plays  
the events in sequence making them appear to happen.   
So seeing the Akashic [spellcheck ]cliche for some thing is to absorb all the  
information about it simultaneously. Past present and future all as one.   
Brilliant talk to you dedhed   
Mick   
PS   
Then theres that experience just outside Samadhi where the Universe is  
percieved within one.   
I went into a local shop and the assitant said "Have you tried the Holy herb  
of the Mastecs ? [legal] I could see the entire Universe within me"   
. He has never read any Yoga philosophy as far as know. This ties in with, ;  
page 106, chapterXVIII Self-realisation, instructions to F H Humphries. By B  
V NARASIMHA SWAMI. The quote goes.......   
Salutations to the feet of the guru Sri Dakshinamurti, who sees within himself  
the entire Universe, which resembles the image of a city in a mirror. Which  
appears to be outside of him just as objects seen in a dream are outside the  
dreamer, but which merges into himself in the state of realisation-for then he  
sees the self alone and not the objects he dreamt of."   
Its seems that the Cosmic mind has the Universe within it independant of sense  
impressiions   
This book seems to have been signed by Ramana Mahrishi himself!!!!! Its from  
the ashram in the 1930s!!!

"Material universe has got substance outside the mind of   
the observer". It is okay. But is it true? Sanskrit employs   
two words, Satya and Mithya, the Real and the seemingly   
real. Material universe is continued to be observed by "other   
observers", even after I die. Imagaine a situtation, when all   
human beings in this world die simultaneously in some inter-   
galactic war, will the material universe be there still? If so,   
for whom? Hence, it is only for the observer, that universe is   
real, or relatively real and no universe exists apart from the   
observer. Bhagavan says," that the Real is only Swarupa. The   
jagat (world or universe), jeeva (the soul or individual, the single   
I) and Eswara (God outside) are all imaginations, like silver   
in the oyster shell. Jagat is I-I, jeeva is I-I and Eawara is I-I.   
 All are Shiva, the I-I." (Who am I?).   
Further Roger Penrose, Richard Feynaman, Stephen Hawking (?) says that if you  
become smaller than a subatomic particle, you can walk through the wall! This  
has in fact, been done by some Saiva Siddhantis!

Subramanian.R   
What I was trying to say is.   
Most definately what we experience as " The World " is actually a picture  
within us manufactured by the mind from sense impressions.   
Sensory information travels up the nerves to the brain where, i Quote Ramana "  
It gets cordinated ". So it's like the mind creates the world from a synthesis  
of sense impresions, Which are interpreted by the mind using archetypes.   
Fixed modes pf thought. Friend, enemy, atractive, repulsive, dangerous, are  
all archetypes. What is always so amazing about Ramana is how he gets so much  
into so few words. The book "Who am I "sums up the whole mind succinctly and  
perfectly.   
However   
He did admit that the material world is real somewhere in David Godmans book  
,I think that he always directed people to self inquiry not to questions about  
the reallity of the world. However I think that what we believe is the world  
is a construct of the mind as he said but I think that there is some sort of  
existence coresponding to the material world it's just that all we know of it  
is from a picture within us contructed by the mind which isn't real in the  
same way that a picture on a TV screen isn't the world that it depicts.   
Until Self Realisation you have to deal with the world as it comes

Dear mick, I quite agree with you. What I was trying to explain   
is that Sankara, in order to satisfy the "world is real" dualists, said   
that the world is "real" but only "seemingly real" (mithya), till one   
is realized, where after this will also disappear. Bhagavan   
also said that when a film-negative is exposed to the sun, it will   
not take any other image. If one is self-realized (that is exposed   
to the Sun of suns, Brahman), he will not gather any other image. The   
Seer becomes the Screen! In this context, some astro-physicsts   
believe that there is no one universe, but a di-verse, and every thing   
that happens in this universe, is happening in the same point of time   
and space in the di-verse also! Bhagavan has also said that " He lives   
simulataneously in twenty lokas and is doing the same thing!" When   
someone asked, "whether Indraloka, Chandraloka, Kailasa and Vaikunta   
\-- are all real?" Bhagavan said, "Yes, as you are all sitting before me,   
some others are also sitting before someone there!" Arunachala-Siva.

We think human beings are having sixth sense and in this form we can easily

animals who lived during Bhagavan's time. which did not have sixth sense. With  
the touch of Bhavan the monkey, peacock, sparrow, squirrel and cow and more  
all they realised their forgetfullness and remembered their goal. So fortunate  
beings all got merged with their soul. Before Bhagavan's time there are many  
stories goes. In kalahasti, the spider and sanke got mukti. In Madurai Lord  
siva gave to stone elephant. And nobody can forget Gajendra Moksham. How this  
forgetfulness happened to mankind so deeply. Bahavan's kind words gives me  
strength   
without thinking like I am a great sinner, go to the source.... so soothing

We think human beings are having sixth sense and in this form we can easily  
get attaintment. After going through the forgetfulness page, I recollect the  
animals who lived during Bhagavan's time. which did not have sixth sense. With  
the touch of Bhavan the monkey, peacock, sparrow, squirrel and cow and more  
all they realised their forgetfullness and remembered their goal. So fortunate  
beings all got merged with their soul. Before Bhagavan's time there are many  
stories goes. In kalahasti, the spider and sanke got mukti. In Madurai Lord  
siva gave to stone elephant. And nobody can forget Gajendra Moksham. How this  
forgetfulness happened to mankind so deeply. Bahavan's kind words gives me  
strength   
without thinking like I am a great sinner, go to the source.... so soothing  
words

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Instead of lamenting how self forgetfulness happened to us better we do "who am i"enquiry and claim our "self".Life is very short,we   
should not deviate from the main purpose of life.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
In Arunachala Sthala Mahtmaym, there is a story of a dry thorn   
bush, cactus, getting liberation, after Siva treaded on it! The   
spider and the elephant getting mukti is nararated in the Sthala   
Purana of Tiru Anaikka, a Siva temple, about 4 kms from

Mano nasa......   
If we have no manam (mind) suddenly, can we live in the present society. For  
day to day life is not necessary to have mind......Especially if you have a  
family and kids who do not have spiritual incliantion. comments please

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Manonasa does not mean destruction of mind in the literal sense.Mind is a very valuable tool available to us because it is a reflecting medium of Pure conscious being.This reflected light is useful to see the things in the phenomenal reality.Manonasa means destruction of   
snakalpa and vikalpa dosha.Rest of the mind functions normally even after  
manonasa.Bhagawan gave excellent guidance to humanity through   
his teaching on self-enquiry only after manonasa.In manonasa unwanted doshas  
of mind are destroyed,rest are preserved as before.   
You will attend to your family and kids more sanely after you attain  
manonasa.So dont be afraid of manonasa,kindly long for it.

Dear Ramanaduli, What Raju says is correct. Sri Sadhu Om   
says two things about mano nasa.   
1\. As Raju says, killing only the sankalpa and vikalpa dhosha. It   
is like roasting the gold in fire, to remove the impurities.   
2\. The other is destruction of the mind. Here again, even after   
the destruction of the mind, the mind remains as Pure Mind or   
Suddha Manas. This Suddha Manas does all the worldy work.   
It is the Pure Mind with which Sankara and Bhagavan composed   
all the poems and other works!   
Arunachala Siva.

No no duality whether attending to self inquiry or doing waht ever ;

Dear DRPVSSN Raju and srkudai, Attending to the self-enquiry, that is,   
asking, "Who am I?" is also a thought. This one thought, will ward off   
all other thoughts, and eventually, even this will burn itself, like   
the stick that is used to stir the funeral pyre. (Who am I? - 1902)   
Dear srkudai, Nice, but you are telling the 'ultimate'.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, Do not rush to where even the angels fear to go! Even during  
enquiry there is duality. Duality vanishes only when you are   
self realized. Then, there is no Subramanian, no non duel, no Sankar,   
no DRPVSSN Raju, no srkudai. One is One without a Second!

Dear Sankar, There is duality till the self enquiry or self   
surrender merges into the goal, the Self. Then, there is   
selflessness, that is there is no individual self or soul. But,   
it is full of SELF-ishness!

Ramana Maharshi says Duality (dvaita) even during sadhana is not present   
 **Even the argument which says, Duality (dvaita) during practice (sadhana)   
which one undertakes (due to) not knowing (the truth that one is always  
Brahman)  and nonduality (advaita) after attainment (that is, duality is true  
during the time of practice and non-duality becomes true only after the  
attainment of Self-realization), is not true. Who else is one except the  
tenth man, both when one is anxiously searching (for the tenth man) and when  
one finds oneself (to be the tenth man).**   
Sri Bhagavan says that even this is not true, because nonduality (advaita) is  
always the truth and duality (dvaita) is always unreal. That is, the one non-  
dual **Self alone exists and is real** even when in the ignorant outlook of  
the individual it seems to appear as this unreal world of duality and  
diversity.   
In order to emphasis that duality is unreal even during the time of its  
seeming existence, Sri Bhagavan cites the parable of the lost tenth man.  
_Ten foolish men forded a river, and on reaching the other side they wished to  
make sure that all had crossed safely. So all of them began to count the  
number of persons on the shore, but since each one forgot to count himself,  
they all counted only nine. Believing that one of their companions must have  
drowned, they all began to weep, until a passing wayfarer who understood the  
situation asked each one to count himself, whereupon they realized that they  
were always ten men, both during the time of their seeming loss and after  
their finding the missing man. Similarly, when we attain Self-knowledge we  
will realize that non-duality (advaita) is always the sole truth,both during  
the time of our seeming ignorance (when nonduality appears to be lost and  
duality appears to prevail) and after our attaining Self, the non-dual  
reality._   
 **It is to be noted here that, though non-duality is the truth even during  
the time of seeming ignorance, this does not mean that no spiritual practice  
(sadhana) is necessary,as some theoreticians/theorists have wrongly  
concluded.So long as the tenth man appears to be lost, it is necessary for  
each one of the ten to enquire and find out Who is lost?, for then only  
will the truth be realized that the so called lost tenth man is only  
oneself, who has in fact never been lost. Similarly, so long as the experience  
of non-duality appears to be lost, it is necessary for us to enquire and find  
out Who am I, who have lost the experience of non-duality?**, for then only  
will the truth be realized that the seeming individual I who does not  
experience non-duality is merely an unreal appearance, and that the real I  
has in fact never lost the experience of non-duality.
