My first visit to Ramanashram a year back has impacted the way i look at  
life. I have been contemplating existence and the question of who am i. I  
have been living in cost rememberance of sri Ramana Bhagawans teaching.  
Sometime i feel a bit lost caught between needs of daily life and wanting to  
spend quality time in peace. I have two questions   
1\. How would someone like me progress in this path and still be able to  
manage committments to family. H   
2\. Since there seems to be no method to self inquiry how do i progress ?

Hi,   
Very nice to hear, the seed has been sown, and keep practicing Self-Enquiry  
and every thing will be fine.   
Both of your questions have one answer.   
As told in Bhagawad Geetha, Keep working and dont expect anything from it. I  
dont mean salary. ...   
Well, though in the initial stages one will be in this kind of dilemma, it  
will be cleared once you start practicing self-enquiry.   
Read Upadesa Saram, first in that bhagavan has clearly mentioned about self.   
As far as answer to your question, **starting doing meditation every day  
before you sleep and before you get up.**   
if you forget even one day, then all the work you have been doing will be  
lost.   
and the question rises, what i have to do in meditation? well, destroy every  
thought that rises during that period then and there.   
this process leads to SELF-ENQUIRY...   
Just start, every thing will be fine   
cheers

Ramana says when a thought arises simply ask who is having this thought? Who  
is asking these questions?   
It is not to destroy thought, but rather it is to turn the mind inwards the  
questions and thoughts will fall away, the mind becomes quiet, self is  
realized.

Dear Mohan Krishanan, there is no conlict between Ramana-dhyanam   
or Self-Enquiry and household chores, even though most of us are   
not still able to fully reconcile. Scriptures speak of nishkamaya karma,   
or working without desire for fruits. It is again difficult for most of   
us but practice will help. There is a story about Bhagavan. When He   
was strolling around the Hill, He picked a small branch of a tree, cut   
it to suitable size, and rubbed and polished it with leaves and made a   
nice stick. On His way, a shepherd came searching for his missed stick,  
andBhagavan readily gave the stick to him.
