## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Nisargadatta Maharaj says Notion of Doership is Bondage  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 05, 2010, 07:23:57 AM

Q: That we understand, yet constantly we make attempts to live our lives  
instead of just living. Making plans for the future seems to be an inveterate  
habit with us.   
M: Whether you plan or don't, life goes on. But in life itself a little whorl  
arises in the mind, which indulges in fantasies and imagines itself dominating  
and controlling life. **Life itself is desireless.** But the false self wants  
to continue -- pleasantly. Therefore it is always engaged in ensuring one's  
continuity. Life is unafraid and free. As long as you have the idea of  
influencing events, liberation is not for you: **The very notion of doership,  
of being a cause, is bondage.**   
Q: How can we overcome the duality of the doer and the done?   
M: Contemplate life as infinite, undivided, ever present, ever active, until  
you realise yourself as one with it. It is not even very difficult, for you  
will be returning only to your own natural condition.   
Once you realise that all comes from within, that the world in which you live  
has not been projected onto you but by you, your fear comes to an end. Without  
this realisation you identify yourself with the externals, like the body,  
mind, society, nation, humanity, even God or the Absolute. But these are all  
escapes from fear. It is only when you fully accept your responsibility for  
the little world in which you live and watch the process of its creation,  
preservation and destruction, that you may be free from your imaginary  
bondage.   
Q: Why should I imagine myself so wretched?   
M: You do it by habit only. Change your ways of feeling and thinking, take  
stock of them and examine them closely. You are in bondage by inadvertence.  
Attention liberates. You are taking so many things for granted. Begin to  
question. The most obvious things are the most doubtful. Ask yourself such  
questions as: Was I really born?' 'Am I really so-and-so? 'How do I know  
that I exist? 'Who are my parents? 'Have they created me, or have I created  
them?' 'Must I believe all I am told about myself?' Who am I, anyhow?'. You  
have put so much energy into building a prison for yourself. Now spend as much  
on demolishing it. In fact, demolition is easy, for the false dissolves when  
it is discovered. All hangs on the idea 'I am'. Examine it very thoroughly. It  
lies at the root of every trouble. It is a sort of skin that separates you  
from the reality. The real is both within and without the skin, but the skin  
itself is not real. This 'I am' idea was not born with you. You could have  
lived very well without it. It came later due to your self-identification with  
the body. It created an illusion of separation where there was none. It made  
you a stranger in your own world and made the world alien and inimical.  
Without the sense of 'I am' life goes on. There are moments when we are  
without the sense of 'I am'. at peace and happy. With the return of the 'I am'  
trouble starts.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says we should conquer the world through our spirituality  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 05, 2010, 07:27:58 AM

**THE WORK BEFORE US (Delivered at the Triplicane Literary Society, Madras)   
Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora  
_The Mohammedan conquest gave us many good things, no doubt; even the lowest  
man in the world can teach something to the highest; at the same time it could  
not bring vigour into the race. Then for good or evil, the English conquest of  
India took place. Of course every conquest is bad, for conquest is an evil,  
foreign government is an evil, no doubt; but even through evil comes good  
sometimes, and the great good of the English conquest is this: England, nay  
the whole of Europe, has to thank Greece for its civilization._   
We cannot do without the world outside India; it was our foolishness that we  
thought we could, and we have paid the penalty by about a thousand years of  
slavery. That we did not go out to compare things with other nations, did not  
mark the workings that have been all around us, has been the one great cause  
of this degradation of the Indian mind. We have paid the penalty; let us do it  
no more. All such foolish ideas that Indians must not go out of India are  
childish. **They must be knocked on the head; the more you go out and travel  
among the nations of the world, the better for you and for your country. If  
you had done that for hundreds of years past, you would not be here today at  
the feet of every nation that wants to rule India.** The first manifest effect  
of life is expansion. You must expand if you want to live.   
**But the gift of India is the gift of religion and philosophy, and wisdom and  
spirituality.**   
Before Buddhism, Vedanta had penetrated into China, into Persia, and the  
Islands of the Eastern Archipelago. Again when the mighty mind of the Greek  
had linked the different parts of the Eastern world together there came Indian  
thought; and **Christianity with all its boasted civilisation is but a  
collection of little bits of Indian thought. Ours is the religion of which  
Buddhism with all its greatness is a rebel child, and of which Christianity is  
a very patchy imitation.** One of these cycles has again arrived. There is the  
tremendous power of England which has linked the different parts of the world  
together.   
The world wants it; without it the world will be destroyed. The whole of the  
Western world is on a volcano which may burst tomorrow, go to pieces tomorrow.  
They have searched every corner of the world and have found no respite. They  
have drunk deep of the cup of pleasure and found it vanity. Now is the time to  
work so that India's spiritual ideas may penetrate deep into the West.  
**Therefore young men of Madras, I specially ask you to remember this. We must  
go out, we must conquer the world through our spirituality and philosophy.  
There is no other alternative, we must do it or die. The only condition of  
national life, of awakened and vigorous national life, is the conquest of the  
world by Indian thought.**   
If the principles are there, the persons will come by the thousands and  
millions. If the principle is safe, persons like Buddha will be born by the  
hundreds and thousands. But if the principle is lost and forgotten and the  
whole of national life tries to cling round a so-called historical person, woe  
unto that religion, danger unto that religion! **Ours is the only religion  
that does not depend on a person or persons; it is based upon principles. At  
the same time there is room for millions of persons.** There is ample ground  
for introducing persons, but each one of them must be an illustration of the  
principles. We must not forget that.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda about Future of India  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 05, 2010, 07:33:02 AM

**THE FUTURE OF INDIA   
Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora**   
The one common ground that we have is our sacred tradition, our religion. That  
is the only common ground, and upon that we shall have to build. In Europe,  
political ideas form the national unity. **In Asia, religious ideals form the  
national unity.** The unity in religion, therefore, is absolutely necessary as  
the first condition of the future of India. There must be the recognition of  
one religion throughout the length and breadth of this land.   
The attempts of the great Ramanuja and of Chaitanya and of Kabir to raise the  
lower classes of India show that marvellous results were attained during the  
lifetime of those great prophets; yet the later failures have to be explained,  
and cause shown why the effect of their teachings stopped almost within a  
century of the passing away of these great Masters. The secret is here. They  
raised the lower classes; they had all the wish that these should come up, but  
they did not apply their energies to the spreading of the Sanskrit language  
among the masses. **Even the great Buddha made one false step when he stopped  
the Sanskrit language from being studied by the masses. He wanted rapid and  
immediate results, and translated and preached in the language of the day,  
Pâli.**   
In connection with this I want to discuss one question which it has a  
particular bearing with regard to Madras. There is a theory that there was a  
race of mankind in Southern India called Dravidians, entirely differing from  
another race in Northern India called the Aryans, and that the Southern India  
Brâhmins are the only Aryans that came from the North, the other men of  
Southern India belong to an entirely different caste and race to those of  
Southern India Brahmins.   
Now I beg your pardon, Mr. Philologist, this is entirely unfounded. The only  
proof of it is that there is a difference of language between the North and  
the South. I do not see any other difference. We are so many Northern men  
here, and I ask my European friends to pick out the Northern and Southern men  
from this assembly. Where is the difference? A little difference of language.  
But the Brahmins are a race that came here speaking the Sanskrit language!  
Well then, they took up the Dravidian language and forgot their Sanskrit.   
Why should not the other castes have done the same? Why should not all the  
other castes have come one after the other from Northern India, taken up the  
Dravidian language, and so forgotten their own? That is an argument working  
both ways. Do not believe in such silly things. There may have been a  
Dravidian people who vanished from here, and the few who remained lived in  
forests and other places. It is quite possible that the language may have been  
taken up, but all these are Aryans who came from the North. **The whole of  
India is Aryan, nothing else.**   
And the theory that the Shudra caste were all non-Aryans and they were a  
multitude, is equally illogical and equally irrational. It could not have been  
possible in those days that a few Aryans settled and lived there with a  
hundred thousand slaves at their command. These slaves would have eaten them  
up, made "chutney" of them in five minutes. **The only explanation is to be  
found in the Mahâbhârata, which says that in the beginning of the Satya Yuga  
there was one caste, the Brahmins, and then by difference of occupations they  
went on dividing themselves into different castes, and that is the only true  
and rational explanation that has been given. And in the coming Satya Yuga all  
the other castes will have to go back to the same condition.**   
The solution of the caste problem in India, therefore, assumes this form, not  
to degrade the higher castes, not to crush out the Brahmin. **The Brahminhood  
is the ideal of humanity in India, as wonderfully put forward by  
Shankaracharya at the beginning of his commentary on the Gitâ, where he speaks  
about the reason for Krishna 's coming as a preacher for the preservation of  
Brahminhood, of Brahminness.  
**It is the duty of the Brahmin, therefore, to work for the salvation of the  
rest of mankind in India. If he does that, and so long as he does that, he is  
a Brahmin, but he is no Brahmin when he goes about making money.** You on the  
other hand should give help only to the real Brahmin who deserves it; that  
leads to heaven. But sometimes a gift to another person who does not deserve  
it leads to the other place, says our scripture.   
You must be on your guard about that. He only is the Brahmin who has no  
secular employment. Secular employment is not for the Brahmin but for the  
other castes. **To the Brahmins I appeal, that they must work hard to raise  
the Indian people by teaching them what they know, by giving out the culture  
that they have accumulated for centuries.** It is clearly the duty of the  
Brahmins of India to remember what real Brahminhood is. As Manu says, all  
these privileges and honours are given to the Brahmin, because "with him is  
the treasury of virtue".   
But it is one thing to gain an advantage, and another thing to preserve it for  
evil use. Whenever power is used for evil, it becomes diabolical; it must be  
used for good only. So this accumulated culture of ages of which the Brahmin  
has been the trustee, he must now give to the people at large, and it was  
because he did not give it to the people that the Mohammedan invasion was  
possible.   
It was because he did not open this treasury to the people from the beginning,  
that for a thousand years we have been trodden under the heels of every one  
who chose to come to India. It was through that we have become degraded, and  
the first task must be to break open the cells that hide the wonderful  
treasures which our common ancestors accumulated; bring them out and give them  
to everybody and the Brahmin must be the first to do it. There is an old  
superstition in Bengal that if the cobra that bites, sucks out his own poison  
from the patient, the man must survive. Well then, the Brahmin must suck out  
his own poison.   
**To the non-Brahmin castes I say, wait, be not in a hurry.** Do not seize  
every opportunity of fighting the Brahmin, because, as I have shown, you are  
suffering from your own fault. **Who told you to neglect spirituality and  
Sanskrit learning?** What have you been doing all this time? Why have you been  
indifferent? Why do you now fret and fume because somebody else had more  
brains, more energy, more pluck and go, than you? Instead of wasting your  
energies in vain discussions and quarrels in the newspapers, instead of  
fighting and quarrelling in your own homes  which is sinful  use all your  
energies in acquiring the culture which the Brahmin has, and the thing is  
done.   
A far greater work is this sacrifice of yourselves for the benefit of your  
race, for the welfare of humanity. What is in this life? You are Hindus, and  
there is the instinctive belief in you that life is eternal. Sometimes I have  
young men come and talk to me about atheism; **I do not believe a Hindu can  
become an atheist.** He may read European books, and persuade himself he is a  
materialist, but it is only for a time. It is not in your blood.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda about Vedanta  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 05, 2010, 07:39:06 AM

**THE VEDANTA IN ALL ITS PHASES   
(Delivered in Calcutta)**   
Whatever system in India does not obey the Upanishads cannot be called  
orthodox, and even the systems of the Jains and the Buddhists have been  
rejected from the soil of India only because they did not bear allegiance to  
the Upanishads. Thus the Vedanta, whether we know it or not, has penetrated  
all the sects in India, and what we call Hinduism, this mighty banyan with its  
immense, almost infinite ramifications, has been throughout interpenetrated by  
the influence of the Vedanta. **Whether we are conscious of it or not, we  
think the Vedanta, we live in the Vedanta, we breathe the Vedanta, and we die  
in the Vedanta, and every Hindu does that.**   
**But the Western people never made a move more, they remained there, they  
failed in the search for the solution of the great problems of life and death  
in the external world, and there they remained, stranded; our forefathers also  
found it impossible, but were bolder in declaring the utter helplessness of  
the senses to find the solution.** Nowhere else was the answer better put than  
in the Upanishad:  "From whence words come back reflected, together with the  
mind";  "There the eye cannot go, nor can speech reach".   
**So far as the Bible and the scriptures of other nations agree with the  
Vedas, they are perfectly good, but when they do not agree, they are no more  
to be accepted. So with the Koran. There are many moral teachings in these,  
and so far as they agree with the Vedas they have the authority of the  
Puranas, but no more. The idea is that the Vedas were never written; the idea  
is, they never came into existence.**   
They believe in a still higher phase of this Personal God, which is personal-  
impersonal. No adjective can illustrate where there is no qualification, and  
the Advaitist would not give Him any qualities except the three Sat-Chit-  
Ananda, Existence, Knowledge, and Bliss Absolute. This is what Shankara did.  
But in the Upanishads themselves you find they penetrate even further, and  
say, nothing can be predicated of it except Neti, Neti, **" Not this, Not  
this".**   
 **Renunciation, that is the flag, the banner of India, floating over the  
world, the one undying thought which India sends again and again as a warning  
to dying races, as a warning to all tyranny, as a warning to wickedness in the  
world.** Ay, Hindus, let not your hold of that banner go. Hold it aloft. Even  
if you are weak and cannot renounce, do not lower the ideal. Say, "I am weak  
and cannot renounce the world", but do not try to be hypocrites, torturing  
texts, and making specious arguments, and trying to throw dust in the eyes of  
people who are ignorant.   
The land of Buddha, the land of Ramanuja, of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the land  
of renunciation, the land where, from the days of yore, Karma Kanda was  
preached against, and even today there are hundreds who have given up  
everything, and become Jivanmuktas  ay, will that land give up its ideals?  
Certainly not. **There may be people whose brains have become turned by the  
Western luxurious ideals; there may be thousands and hundreds of thousands who  
have drunk deep of enjoyment, this curse of the West  the senses  the curse  
of the world; yet for all that, there will be other thousands in this  
motherland of mine to whom religion will ever be a reality, and who will be  
ever ready to give up without counting the cost, if need be.**

THE COMMON BASES OF HINDUISM   
Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora   
Let them talk of India's regeneration as they like. Let me tell you as one who  
has been working  at least trying to work  all his life, that there is no  
regeneration for India until you be spiritual. Not only so, but upon it  
depends the welfare of the whole world. **For I must tell you frankly that the  
very foundations of Western civilisation have been shaken to their base.**   
The mightiest buildings, if built upon the loose sand foundations of  
materialism, must come to grief one day, must totter to their destruction some  
day. The history of the world is our witness. Nation after nation has arisen  
and based its greatness upon materialism, declaring man was all matter. Ay, in  
Western language, a man gives up the ghost, but in our language a man gives up  
his body. **The Western man is a body first, and then he has a soul; with us a  
man is a soul and spirit, and he has a body. Therein lies a world of  
difference.**   
Do not be in a hurry, do not go out to imitate anybody else. This is another  
great lesson we have to remember; imitation is not civilisation. I may deck  
myself out in a Raja's dress, but will that make me a Raja? An ass in a lion's  
skin never makes a lion. Imitation, cowardly imitation, never makes for  
progress. It is verily the sign of awful degradation in a man. Ay, when a man  
has begun to hate himself, then the last blow has come.   
When a man has begun to be ashamed of his ancestors, the end has come. Here am  
I, one of the least of the Hindu race, yet proud of my race, proud of my  
ancestors. I am proud to call myself a Hindu, I am proud that I am one of your  
unworthy servants. I am proud that I am a countryman of yours, you the  
descendants of the sages, you the descendants of the most glorious Rishis the  
world ever saw. **Therefore have faith in yourselves, be proud of your  
ancestors, instead of being ashamed of them.** And do not imitate, do not  
imitate! Whenever you are under the thumb of others, you lose your own  
independence. If you are working, even in spiritual things, at the dictation  
of others, slowly you lose all faculty, even of thought. Bring out through  
your own exertions what you have, but do not imitate, yet take what is good  
from others.   
We have to learn from others. You put the seed in the ground, and give it  
plenty of earth, and air, and water to feed upon; when the seed grows into the  
plant and into a gigantic tree, does it become the earth, does it become the  
air, or does it become the water? It becomes the mighty plant, the mighty  
tree, after its own nature, having absorbed everything that was given to it.  
Let that be your position. **We have indeed many things to learn from others,  
yea, that man who refuses to learn is already dead.**   
Declares our Manu: -   
"Take the jewel of a woman for your wife, though she be of inferior descent.  
Learn supreme knowledge with service even from the man of low birth; and even  
from the Chandâla, learn by serving him the way to salvation." **Learn  
everything that is good from others, but bring it in, and in your own way  
absorb it; do not become others.Do not be dragged away out of this Indian  
life; do not for a moment think that it would be better for India if all the  
Indians dressed, ate, and behaved like another race.**   
Religion in India must be made as free and as easy of access as is God's air.

It has been said that only a few benefited from association with Bhagavan  
during his lifetime. But is that true?   
It is clearly the case that right-effort produces right-results. Those who  
appear to have progressed to the naked eye were certainly few in number, but  
Bhagavan laid stress on the fact that the inner work is imperceptible - even  
to those undertaking it.   
I give here two quotes -   
Question: Is not Grace the gift of the Guru?   
Bhagavan: God, Grace and Guru are synonymous terms. They are eternal and  
immanent. If a Guru thinks that he can bestow the Self, which is already  
present, he does not deserve the name. The books say that there are various  
kinds of diksha or initiations - hasta, sparsa, chakshu, mano, etc. The Guru  
makes some rites with fire, water, japa, mantras, etc. and calls these  
fantastic performances dikshas, as if the disciple becomes ripe only after  
them.   
What did Dakshinamurti, the Supreme Guru do? He remained simply silent and  
the doubts of the disciples were dispelled: they lost their individualities.  
This is Jnana, and not all the verbiage usually associated with it.   
Silence is most potent in its effects. The Shastras, however voluminous and  
emphatic they may be, fall far short in their effect. The Guru is quiet and  
peace pervades all. His silence is vaster and more effective than all the  
Shastras put together. These questions arise because of the feeling (among  
some) that, having been here for so long, heard so much, exerted so hard, one  
has not gained anything. The work proceeding within is not apparent, though  
the Guru is always within you.   
Talks 398  
The Vichara to know the self is different in method from the meditation  
Shivoham or Soham, Lord Shiva I am or He I am. I rather lay stress  
upon self-knowledge, for, you are first concerned with yourself before you  
proceed to know the world and its Lord. The Soham meditation or I am  
Brahman meditation is more or less a mental thought. But the quest for the  
self I speak of is a direct method, indeed superior to the other meditation;  
for, the moment you get into a movement of quest for the self and go deeper  
and deeper, the real Self is waiting there to take you in and then whatever is  
done is done by something else and you have no hand in it. In this process,  
all doubts and discussions are automatically given up just as one who sleeps  
forgets, for the time being, all his cares.   
Sat Darshana Bhashya  Chapter 5  
To give up attachment to the world is progress, to give up 'I' and 'Mine' is  
progress. Both require effort in the beginning and watchfulness throughout. It  
is unlearning attachment to the illusory that denotes progress and that 'can'  
be measured by the aspirant.   
But no-one ever said that this was easy.   
If you limit Bhagavan to the body during the life of the body, then you  
automatically limit him to the body after his death. How many times did he  
have to say 'I am not the body' before you believe him?   
Bhagavan was a brahma-jnani, the highest of all, the supreme itself, the pure  
Brahman manifest through a transient form! When he said 'I am here, where can  
I go' it was not with reference to the body or its location.   
All is only Brahman - 'you are also here, where can you go?'

Yes Graham, thank you for the quotes. If you allow me to share my view on  
these things.   
It is tirering to see how many teachers, I call them spiritual crooks,  
pretend they can bestow realization on a discipel. Some teachers who are still  
bound by their own vasanas, have the siddhi just to suspend for a while the  
disciplels' identification. They often call this selfrealization. The teacher  
becomes famous for that. ... or rich or both. But when the discipel is not yet  
mature for the experience one will notice his waxing Ego after this so called  
realization. He might start teaching himself based on the glimpse of non  
duality he got and often we will see a new fanclub arise around him or her.   
Sages like Bhagavan Ramana are identified with Love and whenever ons sits with  
such Being without a trace of distrust, one will no doubt experience that  
Love. It has nothing to do with shaktipat, transmission, or just being an  
advanced sadhaka. Just the absence of distrust will do the trick. But so few  
can be free from fear due to their vasanas.   
Some people have complete trust in a teacher who is actually a crook. It is  
the absence of distrust that might give them an experience of non duality. Of  
course the teacher will take credit for it and one will read later, He or she  
got enlightened through Swami such or such. It is all bogus. It was the  
temporal absence of distrust that did it.   
All peace can be found within ourselves.   
Have a good day   
Hameed

@Urmish Mehta   
There is some benifit in knowing one is chained but it does solve the problem.  
It even has its own disadvantages.   
People can get very depressed. Desires will no longer find gratifications.  
Human relations are boring. Spiritual teachers have nothing to offer etc. One  
sees their shortcomings.   
There is a feeling one is wasting one's life. In Yoga Vashista it is said that  
such people sometimes create a mess around themselves just to experience what  
will happen, especially what will happen to their minds.   
 Anyway, it is all not in our hands and existence does not waste any time.

What you say is right Mark.   
Usually it is the satguru who is coming close and when he comes he will remove  
the ashes of what one thought were the chains of the world.   
No realization without a living guru. Only he can be the satguru.

## Re:[24]God, the world and unlearning!  
Author: Graham              Date: August 24, 2007, 01:00:07 PM  
---  
It is very clear from many of the opinions expressed on this forum and by the  
self-styled advaitic teachers who abound today, that there is a profound  
misunderstanding of the true teachings of Bhagavan and those of the other  
great sages.   
The simple truth, is that everything a serious seeker needs to know to fully  
understand Bhagavan's teaching and the way to genuine enlightenement, is  
contained in two books - the Srimad Bhagavatam and Tripura Rahasya, both of  
which are ancient sanskrit works recommended by Bhagavan to serious seekers -  
both are now available in English.   
The fundamental misconception relates to effort and its purpose - from that  
every other error arises.   
Here is a synopsis of the Highest Truth extracted from the two works mentioned  
above: The world and everything in it from the beginning to the end of time is merely  
an impression formed upon the pristine substratum of the Self (God, the  
intelligent principle). It has no basis or reality of its own beyond that of  
its source.   
It is unreal because of the lack of an independent existence, but is real  
because of its source. This can be clearly understood by comparison with our  
own experience of dreams.   
We all dream, creating and living in different circumstances for the duration  
of the dream. Throughout the dream we believe it to be real and it is only  
when we awaken that we know it to be unreal compared to the waking state.  
Despite this knowledge when awake we continue to enjoy or suffer in ignorance  
during dreams night after night, believing them to be real whilst immersed  
within them.   
In the same way, the waking state is unreal compared to the true waking state  
of self-realisation.   
What is self-realisation? This is clearly defined as 'pure intelligence'  
devoid of differences.   
Creation is God's deliberate dream (for want of a better term), populated by  
God, who covers himself with ignorance as the many jivas, suffering the pain  
of transmigration until such time as he realises his error, seeks  
enlightenment and returns to the pristine state.   
God as both creator and creation is not limited to one form; whereas we,  
having very weak minds, can only create and inhabit one form at a time, even  
in dreams.   
That is it in a nutshell, but it is slightly more complex than stated above.   
The effort that is required by the seeker to gain self-realisation has been  
described very clearly as 'unlearning' by Bhagavan and the other great sages.   
Incarnation is the fruit of habitual ignorance based upon the belief that the  
illusion is real and that the Reality behind it is in fact an illusion. It is  
this which has to be unlearned and the truth revealed in its place.  
Accomplishing this is not as easy as it is to say the words and even after  
hearing the truth or having a flash of pure consciousness, the majority  
continue to indulge in the illusion and lose sight of the reality underlying  
it. This is where effort comes in.   
Lord Krishna says in the Srimad Bhagavatam: You have, O King, fully understood the teaching of Narada and Angira. It is a  
fact that all created beings are Myself. The Vedas which reveal the Reality  
are My own body. The subject (or perceiver) should understand himself to  
pervade the whole universe, which is the object of his perception, (that is,  
the universe, which appears to be the field of his actions, resides in  
himself).   
He should, again, view Me as pervading him as well as the universe  both  
being My own conception. Just as a dreamer dreams his being fast asleep and  
dreaming of things (friends, relations, business, etc.), which are really  
inside him, and when he wakes up from this dream to the original one,  
imagines himself awake though he is still dreaming, even so the perceiver  
should realise this waking (state) as a mere dream created by Maya, the  
jivas own deluding power.   
Therefore one should break the illusion of this waking state by fixing ones  
attention only on Me, its Witness. Know Me to be the transcendental Reality,  
the very Self (of the dreaming jiva), Brahman, the Consciousness which  
experiences and transcends the three states of waking, dreaming and dreamless  
sleep.   
When this My essence, is forgotten, the jiva comes to imagine himself  
different from Me and, thus, starts turning endlessly on the wheel of birth  
and death.   
He who fails to take advantage of his human body through which he can acquire  
Self-knowledge can never hope to live in peace. One should, therefore, stop  
indulging in activities which appear to be conducive to freedom and  
happiness, but from which one reaps nothing but misery. Using discrimination  
and wisdom one should give up the sense-pleasure of this world and the next  
and develop devotion to Me. For only through intense concentration can the  
mind acquire the power to realise the identity of the jiva with the Supreme  
Spirit (Myself) which is the sole aim of all human endeavour.   
Bear this teaching in mind, O Chitraketu, and act diligently upon it, and you  
will not fail to gain this Knowledge which is the Supreme Perfection.   
\   
If wronged, dear Son, you should not wrong in return. He who does not yield  
to anger earns all the merits of him who displays it. Never should you hurt  
others by cruel words nor defeat your foe by despicable means. He who utters  
scorching words to torture others carries rakshasas (demons) in his mouth: prosperity and luck fly away from him. You should always keep the virtuous as  
a model for all your behaviour and should compare your acts retrospectively  
with theirs.   
You should ignore the hard words of the wicked. He who is wounded by the  
shafts of a cruel speech nurses his wounds by weeping day and night, which  
strikes at the very core of his being. The wise never fling such arrows as  
these. There is nothing in the three worlds which can please the gods more  
than kindness, friendship, charity, sympathy and sweet speech. You should  
show regard to those who deserve it and should always give but never beg.   
I have indicated in brief all these manifestations of Mine, but you must know  
them to be nothing but fancy of the imagination  mere words, unreal. You  
will do well to control your speech, mind and senses, and you will never  
again suffer transmigration. He who fails to control his mind and tongue,  
will find all his spiritual attainments will leak out of him like water out  
of an unbaked pot.   
\   
In order to lead men to the highest good, three methods of self-discipline  
have been taught by Me. They are Jnana Yoga, the path of Knowledge (or  
investigation), Karma Yoga, the path of Action, and Bhakti Yoga, the path of  
Devotion. The first suits best him who has lost all taste for worldly action,  
considering it to be the source of all misery, whereas to him who thirsts  
after fulfilment of desires through action, Karma Yoga brings the desired  
end. The path of devotion is good for him who is neither disgusted with sense  
pleasures nor inordinately attached to them, and who, by some good fortune,  
loves to hear My stories and chant My name.   
So long as one clings to worldly pleasure and has not developed devotion, he  
should perform his duties according to the injunctions of the Scriptures. He  
who worships Me through sacrifice with desire for its fruits, O Uddhava, goes  
neither to heaven nor to the nether regions, but continues to take a human  
body and follow the straight course, abstaining from sins and purging himself  
from impurities till he attains Jnana (Supreme Knowledge) and devotion to Me.  
It is for this very purpose that the denizens of heaven, like those of hell,  
aspire to take birth in this world, where alone Jnana is attained.   
The wise should long neither for heaven nor for hell, nor should they seek to  
perpetuate this body, attachment to which is bound to lead them astray, but  
should strive for Liberation through it before it is cut down by death, like  
the intelligent bird who escapes to freedom betimes before the tree in which  
he has built his nest falls by the woodcutters axe.   
He who is alert enough to notice his life getting shorter by every day and  
every night that passes, will lose no time in giving up his attachment to the  
body and all its activities. He truly commits suicide who does not endeavour  
to cross the dark sea of ignorance and transmigration whilst he possesses  
this sea-worthy boat, the body, which is most difficult to obtain, the guru  
being its pilot and I, the favourable wind, to take it safely to port.   
Full of renunciation and repugnance for action and its fruits, the seeker  
should constantly practise concentration, and should be always alert to bring  
back the mind when it strays and breaks loose from his grasp by pleasing  
contrivances. He should intently watch its movements and, using his reason  
enforced by a sattvic (purified) intellect, he should bring it under  
subjection, as he would an unbroken horse by first conciliating it. This way  
of taming the mind is considered to be the highest yoga.   
In his meditation he should reflect on the ultimate principles and the  
process of creation as taught by the Sankhya, and dwell again and again on  
the teaching of the guru in order to claim the modification of the mind. He  
should also with a sharp intellect inquire into the identity of the jiva with  
the Supreme Self.   
Should the yogi by mistake commit an undesirable act he must endeavour to  
counteract it by yoga alone (take to more intensive meditation and  
reflection), and by no other means; for adherence to ones sadhana is highly  
virtuous. The distinction made between virtues and sins (merits and demerits)  
have the one purpose, first to dispose of impure actions and then of  
attachment to all actions, which, after all aim at sensuous enjoyments.   
All the desires which are rooted in the heart of the sage who worships Me by  
the yoga of devotion gradually wilt away and, when he realises Me, the knot  
of ignorance which is lodged in his heart breaks, destroying all his doubts  
as well as the unexhausted stock of his karma.   
Thus by the yoga of devotion My devotee gains all that is gained by the other  
two yogas, by penance, by knowledge, by dispassion, by charitable acts, by  
pilgrimage. My devotee desires nothing, not even freedom from transmigration  
if offered to him by Me, for desirelessness is the most direct route to final  
Emancipation. The discrimination between virtue and sin, good and evil, does  
not exist for My pious devotee who sees everything with an equal eye, seeing  
Me, Who stand beyond thought and reason, in it.   
Those who follow the foregoing paths as delineated by Me will attain My State,  
which is free from all fear, and which is known by the name of absolute  
Reality (Brahman).   
End of quotes   
Because the ignorance which perceives the world as real is so ingrained and  
powerful, it requires constant effort to remove it - it will not go away by  
itself. The most potent method is continuous self-enquiry which is both  
direct and one-pointed.   
Simply thinking or saying 'the world is an illusion, I am the Self' is a  
complete waste of time, it merely enhances the already swollen ego. Those who  
promote this pointless activity try to justify their wasted efforts with  
inane teachings aimed at enlightening others whom they consider to be more  
ignorant than themselves.   
The serious sadhaka who wants emancipation in this lifetime should do nothing  
else but perform the required effort continuously until success is achieved.  
He must turn his back on all of the pleasures of the flesh, control his mind  
and drive it within.   
Instant emancipation is very, very rare and can only happen with an already  
purified mind; a mind which is devoid of all attachment. It does not happen  
just because you want it - the desire for it is an obstacle in itself. ..  
this is the conundrum which baffles most seekers, but it is dealt with by  
Bhagavan and the scriptures very clearly and the solution is 'dispassion and  
unlearning'.   
However, if you think that you are ready for immediate emancipation without  
expending any effort then ask yourself these two questions -   
1/ Are you attached in any way to your body and its longevity, possessions,  
family, friends, wealth, your status, property, ideas, thinking, talking,  
rituals, pleasure in any form, pain, etc.?   
Are you ready to give all of your property, possessions and wealth away, turn  
away from everyone you know, become celibate in mind and body and throw  
yourself on God's mercy?   
2/ If God appeared before you and offered you emancipation and the immediate  
end of all births (including this one), in exchange for the petal from one  
flower, would you give it right now?   
Think very carefully about both questions and be honest with yourself. The  
truth is that the vast majority of 'seekers' would run away from either of  
these ideas. This is the measure of how much work is to be done, how much  
effort is required to reach the stage of true dispassion.   
However daunting this appears at first sight, it should not be considered an  
obstacle. It is taught that for every step you take towards emancipation,  
emancipation takes three towards you. Every genuine effort expended in pursuit  
of emancipation is never lost, however small it appears.   
Being the Self 'is' effortless, but first you have to get rid of the  
continuously expended wrong effort of sustaining ignorance, and 'that'  
requires right effort - controlling the mind and forcing it within.   
It might not be easy, but if you really want it you will succeed.

A very intersting thread indeed!   
Hameed's comments are very insightful   
However, I beg to differ in his notion that Gnana and Bhakthi are different!   
Gnana or Pure knowlege is the ultimate destination. Profound Bhakthi, be it  
Guru Bhakthi or Ram/krisna/jesus/allah bhakthi leads us to the same ananya  
bhava where we perseive that worshiper and worshiped are only ONE.   
I believe, bhakthi sustains the gnana and varagya to go thru our day to day  
life laden with responsibilities and role playing.
