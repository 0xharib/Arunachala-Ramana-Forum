I could see some tamil books for download from the 'old' ramana maharshi  
website ( including "Ramana vijayam"). But they ve suddenly disappeared. Could  
you please tell me from where can I find them ? Thanks a lot for creating this  
forum.

Dear Hemaharish, if you know Tamil, you are twice blessed.   
Buy Ramana Nool Thirattu (Complete Works of Bhagavan) and   
start with Naan Yaar (Who am I?)
