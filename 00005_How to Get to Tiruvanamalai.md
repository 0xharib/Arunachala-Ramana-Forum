First, you can fly to Chennai International Airport.   
From here you can,   
(a) Rent a taxi and reach Tiruvannamalai. This may cost you a bit.   
(b) Rent a taxi/auto rickshaw to Chennai Bus station (called CMBT- Chennai  
Mofusil Bus Terminal). The rent of the taxi/auto rickshaw to CMBT should not  
cost you much. And from CMBT, there is quite a good frequency of buses going  
to Tiruvannamalai. Buses are generally good and will take around 3 hrs to  
reach Tiruvannamalai. Last time when I travelled, it costed me around Rs.60  
each way.   
Hope this helps you.

Best way to reach Thiruvanamaiai is by Bus from Chennai. You have trains also  
but very much limited services, however you have n no. of buses from CMBT. As  
suggested by Shival, you shall go by Auto/Taxi to CMBT (Koyembedu is the place  
name) and take a bus from there. It would take roughly 3-4 hours from Chennai.   
As far as accomodations are concerned, if you have a reservation you shall  
stay at Asramam (ideal place and highly beneficial) or you have few good  
hotels (do not expect too much) in and around the temple.   
Visit our Bhagavan's abode and be blessed.

Dear friend,   
 From Goa I think you need to reach Bangalore by train and from Bangalore regular bus services are available to Tiruvannamalai.

Dear Shivani and others, People have given suggestions to   
reach Tiruvnnamalai from Chennai airport. In Tiruvannamalai,   
I have given information about Ashram facilities and meditation,
