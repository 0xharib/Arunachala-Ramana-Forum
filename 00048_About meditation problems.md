Hello everybody,   
I am a new student to Bhagwan's teachings. Sicne few days I will get good  
sleep during meditation. Please tell me how many days it may continue. When  
can I experience my true nature (peace)? Please help me.

Hiya Guru grace   
As I understand it expecting anything at all, waiting for a result, looking  
for a goal or any similar mental actions during meditation defiantely  
interferes with meditation.   
Just do it without caring about it.   
If you fall asleep   
.Do it when you are walking, When you are standing up. Do anywhere anytime  
.Stop in the middle of some daily activity and do it.   
Read Ramana's teaching a lot.   
Read one line that you feel inspiring over and over.   
Keep at it !!!   
Don't worry !!   
Let things take the time that they naturally take. That way you wont notice  
the time passing so much.   
Keep Ramana in your thoughts as much as you can.   
Peace
