Swami Vivekananda had once mistakenly wandered off into to a red light area of  
a country, not understanding the subtle warnings of those with him. Suddenly  
he found amidst a few young, half clad women, amorously accosting him with  
objectionable gesticulations. He was shocked to see them like that.   
Moved by pity and compassion, tears rolling down his cheeks, he asked them  
with a choked voice, **' ' O my Motherhood, what a pity, why did you have to  
stoop down to this level? How can I help you come out??''**   
The women deeply moved in turn, their vulgarity completely evaporated in a  
moment of facing the purity of Swamiji, hurried to cover themselves weeping.

Dear prasanth,   
There is also a story where one dancing girl (of profession of disrepute), was  
giving a dance performance and Swami Vivekananda,   
was staying in another room, in a rich man's house. He did not want to go and  
see the dance thinking in mind about her profession of ill-   
repute. At that time, she was singing song with a meaning that   
what she could do when the God had given that birth to her? How can such a  
great ascetic mistake me for God's leelas?   
This song moved Swami Vivekananda and he came to watch the   
dance performance and at the same time, praying to Kali for forgiveness, for  
his sense of differences in human beings, for the   
faults which are not their own.   
Arunachala Siva.
