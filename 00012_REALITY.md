## No cause and effect?

There is a Hindhu doctrine which states that cause and effect do not exist.   
How can this be true when everything that we percieve is subject to the laws  
of cause and effect?   
I think the answer to this one is simple.   
For instance, take the life of one person.   
First there is the baby, then the child the adult, old age and then death   
The child did not cause the adult, nor the adult cause the old age or death.   
They are all merely stages in the developement of the same entity!   
OR   
A railway line.   
As we travel along the line events appear to pass by but really the events are  
fixed and we merely pass along the line!   
The beginning and end of the line always exist.   
The motion of the train along the line represents the apparent passage of  
time.   
The line is eternal.   
The train/ego appears to move along the line.   
I reckon that everything makes sense, everything fits into a logical pattern  
if we can but see it.   
And everthing has the possibility of being understood apart from I AM, which  
is single and cannot be touched by the mind!

Also I think that Astro Mental refers to that plane of existence where  
,Leprechauns, Fairies, or whatever they are exist. Some sort of disembodied  
minds. When aked if they exist, Ramana said they do. When asked where they are  
he replied " In you".   
Some people have had some experience of this area of the mind under the  
infuence of psychedelic drugs.   
 And very strange it is too!   
Definately not to be played with is the occult!!   
Has an astral quality which reminds one of the smell of sulphur!

Yes, I'm familiar with him, The point I was making was that talk about astral  
planes and so forth are a bunch of Theosophical doctrine that I find  
questionable, and have no need of. Mouni Sadhu, man I haven't heard that name  
in 25 years! I read his "In Days of Great Peace" when I was in high school.  
I think it was my introduction to Ramana and Sri Aurobindo. I was trying to  
remember his name a few months ago, and just couldn't do it. Thanks.   
Speaking of people with ties to Theosophy, what are your thoughts on  
Krishnamurti? I realize he hasn't been dead 50 years, but he never claimed to  
be a guru, so I suppose discussing him is alright.   
Also, have you read The Sufis by Idries Shah?

" What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS."   
What Einstein meant by relativity theory was that time and space are not  
absolutes, but ARE relative to the viewpoint of the observer. And, yes, you  
could say that light doesn't travel at all. From it's own perspective, there  
is no distance traveled, and no time passed. In a very real sense, you could  
say that it is defining distance and time. There are aspects of this that are  
unbelievably bizarre, but it would take up too much space to go into them  
here.   
One weird thing, though, is how light travels. You mentioned the key fact.  
Regardless of the movement of an object, light still moves away from it at the  
same speed. Because there is no such thing as absolute space, no absolute  
framework of space and time. We can only say objects are moving or at rest  
compared to a particular frame of reference. For instance, say an asteroid and  
the earth are on a collision course. From our frame of reference, we are at  
rest, and the asteroid is moving towards us. From the asteroids, it is at rest  
and we are moving towards it. Light does not discriminate. It merely describes  
the distance between the two objects by the time it takes to travel between  
the two, and describes the rate at which this distance is decreasing by  
shifting towards the blue end of the spectrum. Light from both objects will  
appear to have the same blue shift when observed from the other. If objects  
are moving away from each other, light shifts toward the red end of the  
spectrum.

BTW, Physicists are working very hard on a general theory to supplant  
relativity and quantum mechanics, each of which only describe things under  
different circumstances, but contradict each other in their separate spheres.  
So a Theory of Everything is needed, (TOE for short) which can describe  
everything, without having to refer to one theory under certain circumstances,  
and the other to describe events under different ones. The two major  
candidates are loop quantum gravity and string theory, but both are still very  
incomplete, and extremely complicated. And the observation that the expansion  
of the universe is speeding up instead of slowing down has further complicated  
matters. Personally, I think the final theory will incorporate parts of all  
these theories, plus consciousness. When we finally find it, I think it will  
be responsible for a quantum leap in the evolution of the consciousness of  
mankind. Which is why I consider it so important.
