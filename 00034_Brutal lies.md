I came upon this article written by some gentle soul named Nilaram. I quote  
him here: .. . "One very obvious thing about desire that gets overlooked is that every  
desire is a lie. Every desire is based on the idea that things can be  
different than they are, and thats just never been true. Things have never  
been different than they are in that moment."   
He speaks then about whatever desire is present is to realize a lie is being  
believed. To be a lie is to be present to it and embrace that truth.   
Goodness ya gotta love the brutality of that, yeah?

EVERY PATH TOWARDS SELF ENLIGHTMENT YOU WISH TO FOLLOW MUST BEGIN WITH A  
DESIRE. SO WHERE IS THE LIE

where isn't there a lie?   
there is no path, there is no beginning, there is nothing or nobody to follow.

Every desire is based on the idea that things can be different than they are,  
and thats just never been true. Things have never been different than they  
are in that moment."   
What about illusion? The western world beleived say about 400 years ago that  
the earth was the centre of creation, that the sun revolved around it, that  
the earth was flat. When we look into distant galaxies, what we see " in that  
moment" is already in the distant past. As to their being no beginning, your  
mail itself will start a chain reaction.

Yeah I would agree.   
Any belief can change so they are pretty worthless in the long run.   
Mind can't come along for this ride. but what a relief, yeah?

Isn't desire just a mental mechanism to get you to act ?   
Doesn't it just say you will have this nice feeling if you perform this act ?   
Or you will have this bad feeling if you dont ?   
Isn't it true to say that without desire no one would do anything at all !!  
We only BREATHE because we have a desire to !!   
There is even a desire to THINK, it seems to me !!!

it has been said that at some point Ramana had no interest in eating,   
so his disciples fed him.   
awareness is the realization of the truth that   
desire is needed if you are going to be somebody   
but nonetheless they are still lies, no matter how much they are believed

'Mental mechanism', ' desiring', 'feeling' 'acting' are all the   
products of mind. But, 'breathing' and 'thinking' are NOT   
the products of the mind, but organic branches of the mind.   
I believe Upadesa Undhiyar (Sansk. Upadesa Saram) says   
this. But one offshoot subject:- when desire is fulfilled,   
the mind returns to Atma-suka and when hated objects suffer,   
again the mind returns to Atma-Suka

In 'Who am I?', Bhagavan says: "Desirelessness is wisdom. The two   
are different. They are the same. Desirelessness is refraining from   
turning the mind towards any object. Wisdom means the appearance   
of no object. In other words, not seeking what is other than the Self   
is detachment or desirelessness. Not leaving the Self is wisdom."   
By the words, "not seeking what is other than the Self", Bhagavan   
implies "seeking only the Self.". But " seeking the Self " is not a desire,  
but shedding of the undesirables. But for this process, one should   
have some essential desires. Bhagavan did not eat for more than   
20 days in Patala Lingam Cave. He, while in His body, was wearing   
only a cod-piece. He never wore sandals in His life. But, He did not   
disapprove food, clothes and sandals for the seekers. Even these   
desires might go, when you "Be the self' because desirelessness is   
wisdom. When once one knows the Truth, every other thing is a lie.   
Till such time, there will be lies, brutal lies et al. Arunachala Siva.

It's so easy to get lost in semantics with discusions like this. The same  
verbal statement can often be taken to mean the oposite of what is intended  
.Ramana said that the world IS the mind. He said that the mind is only  
thoughts and he said that the source of the mind and the breath are the same.   
It seems to me that the whole of all that we experience is the mind. Like all  
the aparrent qualities of percieved objects, like nice nasty, pleasant  
,horrible are the mind. I believe that the quality of experience is the  
filtered Astral aspect of the Self. Like Sat, Chit, Ananda.   
I reckon that it's a mental mechanism that splits consciousness/I of from  
Ananda/Bliss and creates duality and all the experience of the world.   
Anything which has a predictable outcome or an observable way of working could  
be called a mechanism. So the mind must be a mechanism.   
Mouni Sadhu has written some stuff about cliches, ergregors, archetypes etc  
,Which one might consider to be the labeling of the mind's functions.   
However I do Know that Ramana said that one should cast off the minds  
functions rather than analise them.   
Desire is definately a mechanism that works in a specific way. It keeps  
popping up and suggesting things doen't it [ LOL !!!]   
Peace

I think semantics have sprouted in my case, only after I   
started posting in the Forum. Earlier I was reading only   
Bhagavan Ramana. These writings were not there. In fact,   
everytime I write something, I used to ask Bhagavan, "Is it   
not my ego's mischief?" Only thing I want to clarify is that   
the breathing is essential whether one says that is is the act   
of the mind or not. While eating, clothing or sleeping can be   
posponed or avoided, breathing cannot be postponed or   
avoided. Bhagavan says in Who am I? : "In sleep, breathing   
takes place due to God's will, so that the onlookers may not   
doubt that the man is dead." Arunachala Siva.
