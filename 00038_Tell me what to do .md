Namaste,   
Reasonly I was at Puna for a meditation, and while i was there i had a strong  
urge to go to Thiruvannamalai. I am a lady and I travelled alone from Malaysia  
as my friends wants to tour the city and not spent time on meditation. So I  
contacted one of tourist guide to take me to Thiruvannamalai. I was very happy  
that somebody could take me there. I flew down to Chennai and from here the  
tourist guide took me to Thiruvannamalai. I was not really happy because the  
t.g was taking me on a tour and not to my liking (i was confused with all the  
ideologies of the t.g and was very disappointed) I could not even sit down  
long to do my meditation. I did not even go Girivalam as the t.g said that it  
was only done during Pournami. One thing i would like to say that i felt  
very calm (other feelings i could not really describe) while i was at the  
smaller meditation room.   
I would like to stay at the ashram for sometime and know about Ramana Maharshi  
and about Arunachala. Can someone please advise me?   
Regards   
Shanti Davi

Namaste,   
Please note that the first word of the my last post should read as recently  
and not reasonly.   
Please help me. The place where i reside, not much people knows nor speak of  
Ramana Maharshi, only when i was at Puna, i came to know about Ramana  
Maharshi. The bookshops at my place have only books in Tamil edition and not  
in English Edition. Some what or rather i did manage to get the books on  
Ramana Maharshi. Though meditation is not new to me but this simple process  
of "who am i" given by Ramana Maharshi is something new and has given more  
meaning to me.   
I really want to spend more time at the ashram and get the feel of it. If i  
have said it wrong, i apologise, but please, i hope someone could guide me.   
Best Regards   
Shanti

Dear Shanti Devi,   
I would suggest that you contact Ramanashram directly at: ashram@sriramanamaharshi.org.   
If you look under: http://www.ramana-maharshi.org/   
and then click on accomodation, more information is found.   
Some years ago the Ashram offered foreign visitors a 2 weeks stay at the  
Ashram directly.   
Afterwards it is possible to shift to another stay outside.   
But you have to make your visiting-date well in advance. The Ashram is very  
busy during winter months.   
I am sure someone from here should be able to give more detailed informations,  
if needed.   
Re literature in English about Ramana: Many books are for free download at: http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/Allpub.html   
Also an English Ramana-bio is available for free download at: http://www.lulu.com/content/223964   
(for sold: http://www.lulu.com/content/208022)   
To understand the self-enquire, which Ramana suggested, it is best to read  
"Who am I?" carefully.   
It is also for free on the download-site from Ramanashram   
Trust this helps a bit.   
Kind Regards   
Gabriele

Dear Gabriele,   
Thank you very much for your reply/info. It is of great help to me. Now I  
have some kind of knowledge of what to do.   
I have read "who am I? and i will read it more carefully again. The thing is  
that, when i read it, my mind suddenly becomes overloaded and screams for a  
stop. Perhaps, my mind is not able to accept somethings that is direct and  
simple - too much of conditionings. All the time, i am more accustomed to  
rite and ritual and severe fast and long hours of meditations.   
Now, early in the morning while my family members are still asleep, i walk  
about the home premises and do silent self-enquiry. Suddenly, for a very  
quick seconds my own feet seems alien to me and i get frightened and then it  
is back to normal. Please let me know whether it is the mind that is playing  
this tricks or it is just normal.   
I hope to hear from you.   
Best Regards   
Shanti Davi

Dear Shanti Devi,   
Re your experience I am unsure what to answer.   
The intent practice may cause the body/mind to certain reactions according to  
our structure.   
When I started the practice I became very frightened.   
Perhaps one should not give too much attention on such happenings, but just  
gently continue.   
Gently, not forcibly! The practice must become used - but this normally needs  
its time.   
The "Talks" are a good companion as well.   
"Who am I?" is rather intense. Perhaps good to read through it very slowly.   
Kind regards   
Gabriele
