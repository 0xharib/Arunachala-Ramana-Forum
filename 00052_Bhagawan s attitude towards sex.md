What were Bhgawan's views on sexual lives of people in the world ? Did he  
preach abstinence or moderation or he thought it to be immaterial ? Does sex  
block self-realization ?

Hi,   
 This is a very important question and everu seeker faces it at some time or the else.   
But when it occurred to me, I was a little surprised... Coz the question "is  
eating food a block for self Realization", never occurred to me... but with  
regards to sex, this question is there... is it coz there is an automatic  
conditioning in me to consider sex as "nasty?". .. "nasty coz it has to do  
with the organs that should not be named?" ?? I am not sure... but since the  
doubt was there, I proceeded to inquire...   
long before I understand if sex thought is a problem or not, I should clearly  
understand if sex thought can be avoided or not. And if we observe our thought  
patterns... we shall see that thoughts are never in our control. Thoughts come  
and thoughts go... some external objects may simulate certain thoughts. .. but  
once the external object is seen, the brain works like a computer popping out  
thoughts of various kinds... So no way to avoid any thought [if we are lucky  
we may be able to keep ourselves away from environments that trigger certain  
thoughts, but that too is no assurance that the thought does not arise].   
now. .. just as sex thought, several other thoughts arise in our minds. .. and  
we act upon the thoughts. .. if the thoughts are automatic. .. it is a  
problem...   
if we use the thoughts instead of getting automatically driven by them, then  
its freedom...   
so if sex thoughts drive us unconsciously. .. we do not act, but they drive us  
... we are bound. .. not free...   
This is Ramana's stand. .. Being with the Self. .. you have the freedom to  
chose   
if the freedom is not there. .. no matter how beautiful the experience, it  
being bondage, is inherently ugly...   
In other words. .. the Realised Soul does not look at Sex as a means to make  
himself complete. .. he is complete and therefore what ever he does, he leaves  
a mark of completeness. .. so if he involves in sex. .. it too becomes a  
worship...   
in any experience if we lose ourselves it is bondage. .. finding ourselves we  
make every experience into worship. .. we leave the mark of completeness no  
matter which experience we involve in.   
Love!   
Silence_ Speaks.

In "Talks With Ramana Maharshi" for Bhagavan is quoted as saying that  
brahmacharya, traditionally understood as celibacy, should be understood as  
abidance in brahman or the Self rather than what is done or not done with the  
body.
