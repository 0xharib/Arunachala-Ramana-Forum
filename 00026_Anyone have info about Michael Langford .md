Pranam,   
-If my parents were yogis I would have realized by now.   
-If I had only a few vasanas I......   
-If I had a living master I......   
-If someone had encouraged me in the spiritual path earlier I.....   
-If I had a darshan of Bhagvan I.....   
-If I had more Bhakti I.....   
And so was my past.   
-If I will meditate more I will realize sooner.   
-If I sleep less I will....   
-If I live in solitude I will.....   
-If I meet a living Gnani I will.....   
-If my kundalini awakens I will....   
-If I have constant satsang I will....   
-If I live in Thiruvanamalai I will....   
-If I discipline myself more I will....   
And so will be my future.   
Oh yes, what about the present you say. The "Now".   
Well what is the present?   
Is it the absence of thoughts?   
Is it totally being with what one is doing?   
Being with the "I" maybe?   
Does it all not imply that there is a constant endeavour to achieve something?   
Can a means to an end exist in the present?   
And so is my present.   
Can I ever be free of this cursed mind?   
Maybe, If.....................

Dear Disciple,   
I like your free verses. If I could live for ever in NOW, that is   
more than sufficient. The very fact that we are all eager to   
know about and read Bhagavan Ramana shows that our Past   
had been quite good and our future would also be equally good.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Disciple, I am able to truly understand your position for I find myself  
stuck in a similar kind of situation. Then a voice raises within me saying I  
am already realised, whys is there a need to realise something? Just cut the  
demand to realise something and remain still - just be as I am.   
Its grace Disciple, thats what we need, a time will come surely when Bhagwan  
will take us in himself. the false 'I' or thoughts will get dissolved,  
flushed. we will be one with Bhagwan. till then we should just relish our love  
to Bhagwan. just like how a lover longs to be with its loved one.   
that longing for bhagwan will keep us going. Love Bhagwan, Here is He, such  
loving eyes, care, benevolence, soft, nectar, amrutham everything is he. drink  
that and be intoxicated in Bhagwans love. thats the best resort.   
O Bhagwan I love you,

Dear Subramanianji,   
Very true are your below words   
"The very fact that we are all eager to   
know about and read Bhagavan Ramana shows that our Past   
had been quite good and our future would also be equally good",   
however I feel that I am only feeding my ego as my mind thinks that am in  
pursuit of something unique and only have learned to philosophize till now  
..... as Ramana says in Ulladu narpadhu anubandham   
"For unlearned folk there is only one family consisting of wife,   
children and dependants. But in the minds of those with much   
learning there are many families of books, theories and opinions   
that are obstacles to yoga"   
All I pray to HIM is that even if I have to go through numerous births please  
remind me that I have to seek the kingdom of happiness which is within me and  
not elsewhere, as long as I am reminded and make conscious effort throughout  
my life I will not complain about the miseries with every birth.

Dear Varadharajan,   
You are correct. Book reading particularly the books on philosophy,   
Bhagavan Ramana and various journals and also reading and typing in the Forum  
are all there. This intellectual pursuit comes first. Then, one day we shall  
know that all this reading is no longer necessary and we shall try to beyond  
intellectual pursuits. Bhagavan   
Ramana has said in Who am I?: "Limitless reading is not useful since the Self  
is within pancha-kosas. One may have to forget all that   
reading." It is quite true.   
Bhagavan Ramana is a rare phenomenon, to whom book reading was not necessary  
right from the beginning. He has said that He has read hardly anything, but  
for some Bible lessons, Periya Puranam and Tayumanavar songs. But we are all  
going in the 'normal way' and not through the unique way of Bhagavan Ramana.  
Hastamalaka,   
the disciple of Sankara is another example like Bhagavan Ramana. But all this  
depends on one's 'prarabdha'. Bhagavan Himself has said that perhaps, he had  
completed all such readings in the previous births.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 I feel that intellect is of the head,taught and imposed by the others,borrowed,something alien   
to us,not inborn.One has to cultivate intellect.   
Inteliigence(consciousnes) is a natural phenomenon like breathing and  
seeing.It is inborn,our being,our nature.   
It is intuitive and nothing to do with the head.That is why Bhagawan gave more  
importance to heart than head   
though in the initial stages of inquiry we start with intellect as you rightly  
said.

dear all   
it is my wish to let you know that the ego is by no means the enemy...we  
easely adopt a special "perspektive" (I ope you understand my bad bad english)  
when we do sadhana....we seem to step out of ourselve and start to judge our  
mind....(we do this with our mind of course)   
when we deepen our meditation and seeking, we strenghten the ego alot, but is  
it really this? I do no think so, I tink all this seeing and feeling that  
seems to be so loud and chaotic and distressing speaks for our meditation,  
very very clearly. ..we realize what is going on...   
I would recommend to meditate upon the breath and similar things to calm the  
mind first   
I found it extremely usefull to create what buddhists call bodhicitta  
(altruism, the tought of enlightment....or the wish to enlighten others first  
then yourself, the wish to give yourself totally for others)..this is  
incredible cleaning practice and creates alot of peace and love....it makes it  
much easier to switch to the self, no-mind or non-seeking mind streams...do  
tis trough out the day, before meditation, when you go to sleep or whatever  
(search for an easy tong-len practice discription, this is a wonderfull  
meditation to rest your mind...and it also helps to create a positiv mind)   
...and also USE this mind please, USE it...dont let is use you....you have  
alot of power about your mind so please use it....use your thoughts to create  
a stable mind-stream...use your thoughts to come to rest (say it "I relaxe  
deeply, I lot my thoughts come and go" "I come to rest" etc...it works, so why  
dont use your mind?)   
think about bhagawan, think about peace, think about meditation (this words do  
have incredible power) and as long as we are stuck in the mind we should at  
least create a positive mind stream and see that we can USE it for our  
sadhana...   
"right thought" comes before "transrational"   
so we have to think right before we can transcend thinking...right?

Dear matthias,   
I do not do any breathing exercises. I only watch the breath and   
whenever the mind goes astray, I bring it back by chanting Arunachala Siva....  
and thinking about Bhagavan Ramana in the Old   
Hall, like the Lion, sitting on a rock and inspecting the other animals,   
jackals, deers, bisons and monkeys of the jungle.   
Dear Dr. Raju,   
All reading is an intellectual process. The idea is to de-intellecutlize  
after proper maturity. Reading and writing were also Sadhanas for some people  
like Mungala Venkatramaiah, Suri Nagamma, and Devaraja Mudaliar and Muruganar.   
Dear Ganesh_b01,   
Once you understand the Self within, Maya becomes Suddha Maya.   
It is all the play of Uma.   
Arunachala Siva.

and I feel no effort is required to de intellectualize. When one is ready it  
happens automatically. like a very ripe fruit falls from the tree all by  
itself, because of its own heaviness (truth) and breaks from bondage with the  
branch and the tree.   
Again, its the false 'I' which categorizes something as intellectual and non  
intellectual and this happens because the false 'I' compares itself with the  
outside world. In reality we are all neither of those. neti neti !   
If we look closely inside, we will find out that all these disturbances are  
not really ours but simply incorporated from the society. If we negate all the  
thoughts then what remains IS.

dear subramanian   
one can do whatever one likes to do...but it is good to start with watching  
the breath.. to calm down   
dear ganesh   
I understand neti neti also like this: not ONE not TWO   
so it is not just the absolute and not just the relative   
\   
who negates the thoughts?   
the same who is thinking...so why negating? why not shift to another  
perspective? and let the thoughts arise and why not use them in a wise manner?   
who is disturbed by the patterns of society?   
when I think conciously and when I breath conciously then both breathing and  
thinking does not tie me in bondage...   
and it is much easier to simply be this   
mind that sees mind and is fullfilled   
mind that rests as mind   
this mind is enough, we do not need another or a better mind...   
when the mind rests as the mind all is in equlibrium and the fight is over  
(for some time)...but we also need this mind to survive (at least I do,  
bhagawan was quiet happy without mind eh?) I need this mind to exist, so I  
welcome him, it is good to see him and it is good to be free of the mind  
also...who makes the line between the absolute and the relative anyway? I do  
this, I play the whole game, and I train myself to be at peace with my game..

Dear matthias   
Actually there is nobody or no entity there to negate. What appears to be  
there is just false 'I' which is nothing but gross thoughts alone. Therefore  
Thoughts = false 'I' and what this false 'I' wants is nothing but change,  
existence, continuity. Thats all. It is this false 'I' which has innumerable  
rebirths to keep its agendy going - continuity, existence. It may appear that  
by changing perspective and thoughts we can use them wisely. how long? the  
false 'I' only wants this change alone. thoughts or false 'I' wants only this  
continuity alone. it wants more rebirth, it wants to be born again and again.  
Thoughts wants to continue.   
There is actually no mind to rest at all. only the false 'I' wants this mind  
to survive, to continue, to exist permanently. No matter what 2 false 'I's  
communicate they cannot meet at all. in a glass half filled with water one  
calls it half full (Brahman) and another calls it half empty (Shunya). thats  
all is the difference between my meaning to neti neti and you as not One not  
Two. But we are referring to the same truth ultimately whoever makes the line  
between the absolute and relative.   
Bondage according to me is as long as there is a seer and seen, there is  
bondage, there is thinker, there is thoughts, there is continuity, there is  
existence, there will still be innumerable rebirths.
