What I reckon is...   
What we experience as the body, is a picture of the body which is manufactured  
out of consciuosness by the mind.   
So the answer to the question is both yes and no!   
If the body was ONLY the creation of the mind of the individual, then it  
woild dissapear when it dies.   
This does not happen! Others can observe the continued existence of the body  
when the spirit no longer is connected to it.   
However the picture of the body disapears from the spirit upon death.   
Therefore the reality of the body is similar to the reality of the picure on a  
TV screen. The picture is not the reality that it is a picture of.   
There are ways pf proving this more or less conclisively! But unfortuneately  
they are mostli illegal.

What do we mean by real? Think about this, because language has caused us to  
accept this term without fully identifying what we mean by it.   
Let us look at some other points first, before we go further into this. (I  
wish I had more time to go into this, because one could easily write a book on  
this subject, and still not cover all the implications.)   
When we look at an object, what occurs? Light reflecting from the object  
strikes the eyes and cause a signal to be sent to the brain, whch creates the  
image of that object. We perceive the object as having a certain color. But is  
this color intrinsic to the object, or is it the creation of the interaction  
between consciousness and the physical brain? Science tells us that what we  
perceive as color is a wavelength of visible light. So, the only information  
that the lightwave is carrying is it's wavelength and frequency of vibration.  
There is nothing intrinsically 'red' or 'blue' about this information.   
When we touch an object, it seems solid to us. But physics tells us that if  
we go down to the subatomic level, there is nothing solid there. Only the  
mutually repulsive force of what we call electrons keeps us from falling  
through the floor. And the subatomic particles themselves? They seem to have  
no independent existence, but exist only as an inter-relationship with  
everything else. In isolation, they exist only as probabilities of  
interaction.   
 But probabilities, like consciousness, are not a physical thing. Yet both  
seem to be the basis that the physical universe is built upon.   
 So is the universe dependent upon the consciousness of the individual?  
Apparently not, though you could build a case that since everyone's entire  
knowledge of the universe is based upon your individual consciousness, it  
would be far easier to defend this viewpoint than the independent existence of  
the universe. But it seems far more likely that the universe exists within  
the universal consciousness which we are all a part of.   
 So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space.

Yes thats more or less what I think too.   
What we percieve as colour is actuly divsion of consciuousness. The mind  
creating the experience of colour out of consciousness.   
What I was trying to get at was this issue of independant existence.   
Lsd and other true psychedelic drugs cause the image of the world to change  
and distort. But no other person perceieves this. Also after death other  
people percieve the decay of the body. These two things must lead us the  
conclusion that the material Universe has some sort of existence outside the  
mind of the observer! And we all to some extent percieve the same objects.   
So, i think you are right, it is the Universal mind. The ultimate stuff of  
the universe is consciousness. Subatomic particles and quasars, all the  
galaxies, all Universes..   
Probabilities ? If as they say its all predetermined, then maybe its all like  
a cosmic DVD playing, within the Universal mind.   
Like when you watch a movie there apear to be events, and cause and effect  
,but really its all just the one thing and the laser [ the moment NOW ] plays  
the events in sequence making them appear to happen.   
So seeing the Akashic [spellcheck ]cliche for some thing is to absorb all the  
information about it simultaneously. Past present and future all as one.   
Brilliant talk to you dedhed

PS   
Then theres that experience just outside Samadhi where the Universe is  
percieved within one.   
I went into a local shop and the assitant said "Have you tried the Holy herb  
of the Mastecs ? [legal] I could see the entire Universe within me"   
. He has never read any Yoga philosophy as far as know. This ties in with, ;  
page 106, chapterXVIII Self-realisation, instructions to F H Humphries. By B  
V NARASIMHA SWAMI. The quote goes.......   
Salutations to the feet of the guru Sri Dakshinamurti, who sees within himself  
the entire Universe, which resembles the image of a city in a mirror. Which  
appears to be outside of him just as objects seen in a dream are outside the  
dreamer, but which merges into himself in the state of realisation-for then he  
sees the self alone and not the objects he dreamt of."   
Its seems that the Cosmic mind has the Universe within it independant of sense  
impressiions   
This book seems to have been signed by Ramana Mahrishi himself!!!!! Its from  
the ashram in the 1930s!!!
