I wanted to know if any one knew of any realized persons living in this world  
now. I would be happy to meet someone like Ramana today. If any one knew  
please do respond.   
Thanks

try to meet the innate realization within you. You dont need to meet anyone  
else.

Hi, In my opinion, i think Sri Mathru Sharada and her guru Sri Lakshmana  
Swamy, who in turn was a disciple of Sri Ramana, are living realised beings. I  
also am searching for accessibility information to them since it is said that  
they rarely give public darshan but are somewhere in Tiruvannamalai. Here is a  
link to their experience etc. : http://mathrusrisarada.org/

Thanks for the Mathru Sri Sarada site link. It is the first time I have come  
across it. Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house about a ten-  
minute walk from Sri Ramanasramam. However, they are very private people who  
rarely meet with visitors. Lakshmana Swamy used to give public darshans in his  
garden twice every winter, but in 2006 he announced that he would not be doing  
this any more. There were no darshans in 2007.   
Mathru Sri Sarada is, theoretically, slightly more available. If you want to  
meet with her, you have to go to her gate and send in a message saying who you  
are and why you want to see her. Sometimes she meets with new people who  
approach her in this way, but mostly she does not.   
Lakshmana Swamy and Saradamma live in a private house that is not an ashram.  
Lakshmana Swamy has never been a public figure. For most of his life he has  
rationed access to him to a few times a year. He is fond of quoting Bhagavan's  
saying: 'Self is the only reality. There are no others to mix with.'

Hi sonagiri.   
Thanks for the great info. By the way, here's a rare video of the darshan of  
Sri Laxmana Swamy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-BeVGCINic   
It may not be so rare since its on youtube now..but we are lucky to have found  
it.   
Peace

Could some one tell me "Who Am I" really. Or Why am I ?   
As Ramana said its inner journey.And intellectual reasoning will lead no  
where.   
Knowing this I still do not know and I'm no where near to Who Am I   
But what can "I" do?   
I do not KNOW.   
Please help me

WHO AM I? PRANA CONTROLS EVERY MOVEMENT OF YOUR BODY BUT IT IS NOT TO BE  
MISTAKEN FOR BREATH. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO STOP INHALATION/ EXHALATION FOR A FEW  
MOMENTS BUT ONE OF THE OTHER FUNCTIONS OF PRANA IS ALSO THE CIRCULATION OF  
BLOOD, DIGESTION ETC ETC. WITHOUT PRANA YOU ARE DEAD. SO WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF  
THIS PRANA?   
GO TO THE SOURCE TO FIND WHO YOU ARE

Dear Sunilbabu, I do not know about Mathru Sharada and her   
guru Sri Lakshmanaswami. The last one I know, was Sri   
Chandrasekara Saraswathi of Kanchi, who shed his mortal   
coil at the ripe age of 101, about 15 years back. But, why do   
you insist on a living guru in flesh and blood? Is not Ramana (Self)   
within you, a living guru, who is pulling you from inside? Why need a push  
also from outside? Do not search and roam around. Stay put,   
read Ramana and meditate on Him. He will take care.

Jaggi Vasudev of Isha foundation,coimbattur is a self-realised master with a  
body.It makes no difference whether saints have a body or not because it is  
not their body   
which confers self-knowledge to us.

Dear DRPSSVN Raju, The magazines talk about Jaggi   
Vasudev, Nityananda Swami, Sri Sri Ravishankar and   
others. You can follow any of them. But you are treading   
in the unchartered waters. Bhagavan is an ocean who   
has been already treaded by many others, and who have   
now become the ocean.   
Arunachala Siva.

Well Friends. .. Realized people : a) Sri Ramesh Balsekar: http://www.rameshbalsekar.com/ [You can get the  
contact address] he was a disciple of nissargadatta maharaj.   
b) Swami Suddhananda : www.Selfknowledge.in [Highly recommended to meet.]   
he was a disciple of Sri Dayananda Sarswathi or arsha vidhya gurkul.   
c) Echart Tolle : The author of power of now   
d) titch nath hanh: zen master and the author of "Old Path White Clouds"   
May be Sri Ramakrishna mission's, current head [ i am not sure, one should  
ask him directly if he is realized or not. they will not lie ]   
 Along with the list of realized devotees of Sri Ramana, Subramanian ji  
mentioned in a separate post with that title.   
I guess, from yesterday's conversation, that Michael Langford [who taught  
"awareness watching awareness"] is also self realized.   
Somehow i doubt if Sri Sri Ravishankar or Jaggi Vasudev are realized. They  
emphasize a lot on experience Swami Dayananda clearly says that we do not  
require new experiences ; what we need is a proper interpretation of the  
experiences we already have.   
And also, these people are very money oriented. Swami Sukhabodhananda also  
seems to be money oriented!   
Love!

Dear srkudai, Sukhabodhananda, has written so many books   
in Tamil and English on mind control, without his mind having   
been controlled! You have to pay to listen to his address! Sri   
Sri Ravishankar has founded the Art of Living Course, with   
the aim of teaching correct living. He has not mentioned   
anything about self enquiry. It is he who has now gone to   
Kashmir to solve Hindu-Muslim unrest on account of Amarnath   
Shrine land allotment. Dayananda Saraswati is an exponent   
of Bhagavad Gita, like his guru Chinmayananda, who in the   
past had said that Bhagavad Gita tells everything and Nirad Chaudhry   
blasted him saying that Bhagavad Gita is not telling everything. See   
Nirad Babu's book on Hinduism.

Dear subramanian,   
 I mentioned Jaggi vasudev because sunilbabu99 is insisting on a master with a body.As far as i am concerned i do not need anybody   
except Bhagawan.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, You are correct. Some people feel that   
a living Guru. I have been exchanging views with 'non-duel'   
on this same point. Lakshmana Swamy, who came to Bhagavan   
and stayed in Tiruvannamalai, for many years, has also said   
that a living guru is essential. But I am with you. The Guru   
need not be living in body. His photograph or his books or   
even a mental picture of him will do, to progress in the path   
of self realization. Eventually, after realization, you are he and   
he is you.   
Arunachala Siva.
