## Anyone have info about Michael Langford?

Recently I came across a book called "The Most Rapid and Direct Method To  
Eternal Bliss" by Michael  
Langford:http://astore.amazon.com/powerfulspiri-20/detail/B000KMAUFI/002-9663457-4851248   
According to the author, the author is a follower of Sri Ramana Maharshi and  
became enlightened in early 2004. The methods described in his book are indeed  
very attractive. But I feel he is trying hard to promote his book: creating a  
bunch of not-quite-useful Amazon.com Listmania! Lists and putting his book as  
the first one in the lists, "boasting" his methods being superior than other  
sages' including Maharshi and so on. I don't mean to offend or attack someone  
who really is a realized person or a real sage. But I just don't feel quite  
comfortable to see such commercial-like acts happening. At least, I believe  
Sri Ramana Maharshi would not do someting like these. Any information about  
this author are welcome!

Hello Michael...   
Just one question...does a enlightened person say that he/ she is  
enlightened...shud a enlightened person say I am enlightened..   
are we so gullible...

Is this the same Micheal Langford who wrote the photography books?   
I checked out the link, and there seems to be nothing new in anything he is  
saying, but not having read more than the excerpt, I would not try to pass any  
sort of judgment on it. Still, when people talk of experiencing complete  
enlightenment, one should take it with a grain of salt.   
Also, a thing to consider: Anyone with even a very partial awakening, one of  
the most noticeable things about them will be the warmth and intimacy they  
convey in everything they say and do.

Michael Langford is the real thing but I invite you to verify this for  
yourself. Over the past decade he has devoted thousands of hours to helping  
people in online discussion groups focused on Ramana Maharshi, which is how I  
found out about him. He is not commercializing his material, as everything he  
has written is available freely on the web. He regards Ramana Maharshi as his  
guru and has done a tremendous service by pointing out a way to practice that  
is abundantly documented in the works of Ramana, illustrated further by  
Muruganar, Sadhu Om and Annamalami Swami, but which is missed by many  
commentators. An index to Michael Langford's writings can be found on a page  
titled Awareness Watching Awareness at this address: http://www.albigen.com/uarelove/   
Best wishes to all.

Have you even read the book? He never says "his methods" are anything other  
than what Maharshi and others have taught. I never saw a hint of him claiming  
any method to be his own.

May be the instructions by the author are correct. However it is the vasanas  
who determine whether they work or not. If Michael really lost his body mind  
identification early 2004, awareness will not let him claim enlightenment.   
So many times the deathexperience similar to Bhagavan's happened to me. I  
tried to respond like He did but fear always takes over and the whole thing  
ends up as a bad trip. This means vasanas are still active. It is all not in  
our hands

Do not take these statement like "Ramana is my guru" for granted. Such  
statements have as much value as people to whom Jesus is the real thing or  
Muhammed is the real thing. Michael just made a projection of Ramana and is  
thus guided by his own creation. Probably this Ramana told him he is  
enlightened.

Bravo. ..Yam   
Somebody asked Swami Dayanand....how can you define truth... bcos if truth is  
going to defined then it will be thru words which are limited. ....words are  
limited. .understanding is limited..   
Any definition will have a negation, an opposite view point...   
Dayanandaji said..."something which cannot be negated is truth"....

I have recently found his book and love it!!!   
I am honestly concerned about his ego, I mean he says stuff like   
"That secret and how to break free of that ancient human trap   
is taught in the book "The Most Rapid and Direct Means to Eternal Bliss"....   
For human consciousness to be transformed   
a new and effective solution must be introduced.   
A new and effective solution has been introduced.   
You can read about the new and effective solution   
in the book   
"The Most Rapid and Direct Means to Eternal Bliss"   
Then his amazon section says "This is the book that started a spiritual  
revolution"   
I wonder.... I mean his book touches me deeply.   
Anyway I am wondering his "loving all" method is something he made up or got  
from Ramana.   
peace,

I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?   
Some 5-6 years ago, when I read books by Papaji, Balsekar and teachers like  
them, I was touched so deeply. Everything became clear. I felt free. I felt  
unburdened. Till I realized it was all Ego that was so touched. Ego had become  
the knower!   
Ego told me, take a seat and rest! You are already what you looking for. In  
other words, "abide in Ego".   
Have a good Day BB

"I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?"   
Good question-   
When I ask that question, there is just an experience of spaciousness.   
That is so great that you found freedom from reading some books!

Hiya blissboy   
I think that experience of spaciousness might be a positive move upwards  
[metaphor].   
If everything is the Self, the whole percieved world is a picture within us, a  
picture made by the mind out of sense impressions, then this sense of  
spaciuosness could be an the begining of an awareness of the Self.   
The Self is the Universe, is All of everything.All that we ever experience is  
the Self. Vast, eternal, all pervading. really all we experience is the Self.   
 I went upstairs and got the book "Ramana mahrishi and the path of Self  
Knowledge" I opened it more or less randomly and here is where it opened!!!  
This is what it says!!!   
Page 99 i   
instructions to FH Humpries.   
 H. Master can I help the world?   
Bh.Help yourself and you will help the world.   
H. I wish to help the world. Shall I not be helpful?   
Bh. Yes Helping yourself you help the world.You are in the world, you are the  
world.You are not different from the world,nor is the world different from  
you.   
H. [aftre a pause] Master can I perform miiracals as Sri Krisna and Jesus did  
before ?   
Bh. Did any of them, when he performed them,feel it was he who was performing  
them?   
H. No Master.   
 Ramana says YOU ARE THE WORLD!   
Elsewhere he says the Self is the screen upon which the picture of the world  
is projected!   
He says that the seer of the world, the Aham Vritti [ego] is also on the  
screen.   
So maybe your experience of spaciousness is the beginning of an expansiion of  
consciousness   
Peace   
Mick

Captmj, ask Swami Dayanand whether he he thinks there exists a concept in this  
creation that cannot be negated.   
As far as I know any concept can be broken by a person who act from awareness.
