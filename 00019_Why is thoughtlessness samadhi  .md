Thoughts or no thoughts, how does it matter? Thoughts, whether they appear or  
not, are mithya.   
People who try to stop shadows from appearing or who try to perpetuate shadows  
... both are equally mistaken.   
shadows are shadows, how does it matter whether they exist or not.   
ultimately i alone am!   
Yoga Vasishtam says : Quote  
King Parigha asked king Suraghu as follows: "Are you established in the state  
of supreme pace in which no thoughts or notions arise in your mind which is  
known as samadhi?"   
and Suraghu replied: Holy sir, please tell me why only the state of mind which  
is free from thoughts and notions is called samadhi? if one is a knower of  
truth whether he is engaged in constant action or in contemplation... there is  
only Samadhi.   
Love!   
Silence
