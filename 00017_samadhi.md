If we are not the body, why is there a long standing practise of preserving  
the body of sanyasis, esply why did they preserve Bhagawan's body?

It is tradition to preserve the discarded bodies of Jnani's.   
Their bodies, like the places they stayed, were saturated with the Grace that  
they exuded and this lingers in concentrated form for a period of time after  
discarding.   
Some say that they leave the subtle sheath with the body for a time until it  
dissolves, but in cases like Bhagavan there is some doubt as to whether there  
was a subtle sheath at all. He was a Brahma-Jnani, the highest of the three  
types, ego/personality completely dissolved and therefore there can have been  
no sheaths.   
But only another Brahma-Jnani can answer this question fully.   
Also, according to scripture they must not be cremated as this invites  
conflict in the world.

It is absolutely unnecessary to preserve the bodies of jnanis. who ever  
practised it may not himself have recognized the truth

It is the body, wherein Self remained for 54 years and hence it   
emits vibrations for the seeker. One would know the vibrations,   
if he sits in Matrubhuteswara Temple /Ramaneswara Mahalingam   
Temple for a while. Why there, even the Old Hall, the Jubilee Hall   
and Arunachala emits vibrations, for the seeker with a proper   
"wave-length".
