## Ashram Meditation hall

I recently visited Ramana Ashram in Tiruvanamallai and it was a mind blowing  
place and the place had a certain vibration and tranquility. I could feel the  
master Ramana Maharshi's energy there in a big way. There were people in  
silence and meditatives. I could not approve the fact the meditation hall was  
hijacked by some preist who was chanting mantras, chamakkam and rudram in  
annoyance to the folks who would prefer silence and meditate. It is not about  
being in tranquility but to feel the presence of the master who graced this  
place. The priest grunting mantras was a turn off to folks who wants to  
receive the grace of the master and receive his energy. All these mantras  
chanting is to invoke a certain vibration to create a certain form of energy.  
When the priest is not initiated by the master and the mantras coming through  
a mind of a ordinary preist does not resonate with the master.   
 I somehow feel the mantra chanting and meditation hall should be in different  
place and meditation hall should always be silent. Another suggestion is to  
have the mantra chanting only at certain space and leave the sandya kal time  
for meditation in silence only.

Hi! This is my first message! I am Brazilian and presently live in Minas  
Gerais State, but my origin is Rio de Janeiro. As to your message, I think  
that you may be right. Bhagavan always emphasized the value of silence!  
(Remember = mouna). I am specialy interested in knowing more about the ways  
Bhagavan communicates with His devotees, if it happens! Please, tell me  
something about it! Yours in Bhagavan's grace. Sebastian.

Hi, this is my first message.   
I just wanted to add, that Sri Bhagavan emphasized, that mouna is not physical  
silence, but inner filling

Good point, but at what point did it get annoying was it the mantras or the  
mind playing tricks with you.Ok i understand silence is important but when it  
is not distrubed from within why should external matter. Share the experince  
of the noise that is coming out of the priest voice then we will share love  
with him.Mantras and Meditation ignite together to get blessings...

The meditation hall was far from quiet even in Bhagavan's day. There was a  
radio there in the 1940s and Krishnaswami, Bhagavan's attendant, used to play  
it loudly on occasions, much to the annoyance of visiting devotees. Bhagavan  
was once in the middle of a reply to a question when Krishnaswami came in and  
turned the radio on. Bhagavan suspended his reply, without making any comment,  
waited for Krishnaswami to listen to his programme, and then resumed his  
answer when Krishnaswami turned the radio off.   
When someone once complained to Bhagavan that the noise in the hall was  
disturbing his meditation, Bhagavan replied, 'No one said you have to meditate  
here. If you want to meditate in silence, then you can do it in your room.'   
Bhagavan didn't like to hear complaints from devotees about other devotees'  
behaviour. On such occasions, as a matter of principle, he would generally  
side with or defend the person who was being complained about. When he himself  
was interrupted in the hall by the noise caused by others, he just kept quiet  
until the noise subsided.

Dear Gabriele,   
Apologies for not responding sooner, but I haven't checked the site for a few  
weeks. I was given all the information about events in the hall by Annamalai  
Swami in the 1980s when I visited him. I don't know whether it has been  
printed anywhere. I do remember Suri Nagamma saying how noisy the hall was in  
one of her letters. At one point she had the job of looking after the noisy  
babies there, and cleaning up their assorted messes.

Dear Sonagiri,   
thanks for answering. It is an interesting story and sounds very authentic.   
Yes, I remember the story from Suri Nagamma quite well and it must surely   
have been the case that it was very busy in the Hall - most of all in Ramana's  
later years.   
kind regards   
Gabriele

The story of Kandaswami listening to the radio is also mentioned   
in Ramana Leela of Krishna Bhikshu. Coming to the "noise" from   
"veda mantras", firstly, if one is able to maintain his silence, he can   
do so, without 'listening' to the mantras. Secondly, the mantras,   
are recited by trained people (whether they are in true silence or not,   
is another matter) and its power gets enhanced by Bhagavan,   
who is more powerfully enshrined in the hall. Of course, for most   
of us, external noises from radio, TV etc., do disturb our reading   
and meditating. But perhaps, the way out is, to have the meditation   
in times other than the chanting time.

I visted Ramanasramam, Tiruvannamalai, last week and stayed   
for 3 days in that place. I also heard the "chanting of mantras"   
in the Matrubhuteswara Temple, which is also used for meditation.   
I believed that these 'noises' did not disturb the meditators who   
are 'advanced'. But there is the Old Hall, where there is no   
'external disturbance', and one can meditate any amount of time   
(during the permitted periods). In fact, I meditated there only.

Dear Shivani, Tiruvannamalai is a medium size town, where   
accommodation is available for about Rs 400 per day for 2   
people. Staying Ashram's own guest houses, need prior approval.   
Inside the Ashram, you may visit the Matrubhuteshwar Temple,   
a small Shiva temple, over the samadhi of Bhagavan's Mother,   
and also Ramaneswara Mahalingam Temple, another bigger temple,   
over the samadhi of Bhagavan. You can mediate in the Hall in   
front of Ramaneswara Mahalingam Temple or in the Old Hall,   
(with limited hours of opening) where Bhagavan lived for more   
than 20 years and held court with his devotees. Here is where,   
all the happenings took place. This has been sanctified by thousands   
of Bhagavan's devotees. There is an Ashram Bookshop, where you   
can buy English, Tamil, Hindi, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam books  
and CDs. The Ashram Food centre is available for people on first come first  
served basis. The morning breakfast is at 7.00 AM, lunch at   
11.30 AM and tea at 4.00 PM and evening food at 7.00 PM. These   
are all South Indian vegetarian food and breakfast. In T. Malai,   
there is a very large Shiva temple, which will take about 4 to 5 hours   
if you want to see everything in detail. You can climb the Hill, if   
you can or see Skandasramam and Virupaksha Cave which is about   
1/2 km on the way to uphill. The circumambulation is about 14 kms.   
There is samadhi of Seshadri Swami, who was there during Bhagavan's   
time. There is also a samadhi of Yogi Ram Surat Kumar.   
Arunachala Siva.
