Dear karthikeyan. M   
The answer of Matthias apart, Vedas speak of various deities. But   
Rig Veda starts with Agni, the Fire. From Agni, all gods came!   
The first verse starts: AgnimiLe..... Max Mueller was attracted   
by this first word, and then started reading Rig Veda and he spent 40 years of  
his life in this. During those years, Germany was in war   
with Britain and so he could not come to India. He arranged a Sanskrit scholar  
and read Rig Veda in full. Once in the classroom, (He was a   
Professor in Heidelberg university, if I am not wrong...) the students were  
restless when he was talking about Rig Veda. He started singing AgnimiLe...  
and went about for 20 minutes. The whole class became silent and absorbed.  
Rig Veda and other Vedas, speak about natural   
elements, Agni, Vayu, Varuna, Indra (Indra sometimes means Siva), Vayu and  
Jala and the Bhoomi. Later when it comes to Yajur Veda and Samaveda, they  
speak about Siva, Narayana, Purusha, Uma etc., In Atharvana Veda, they speak  
about other lower gods, like angels used for black magic etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear karthikeyan. M   
Yajur Veda has got Sri Rudram, which is a prayer to Siva. It is   
central to all the four Vedas and Nama Sivaya mantra is in the   
centre of Sri Rudram, as a Ruby held at the centre of a pendant.   
Rig Veda contains Purusha Sooktam, which is a prayer to Narayana,   
the Purushottama.   
The Dravida Vedas are 12 books of Saiva Canons called Tirumurais   
and Naalaayira Divya Prabhandham, which contains roughly about   
4000 verses of Azhwars, on Narayana. These songs have been sung   
in praise of various Siva and Vishnu icons of temples. Thillai or   
Chidambaram is the Temple, central to all Siva temples and Sri   
Rangam is the Temple, central to all Vishnu temples. I am not sure   
whether any one has translated Saiva Canons, excepting Tiruvachakam (which is  
the 8th book) and Tirumandiram (10th   
book) in English. The four thousand verses have not been translated, but for  
a few stray verses by A.K. Ramanujan in his book Hymns for the Drowning. Dr.  
G.U.Pope and Prof. Vankmika Nathan have done   
Tiruvachakam in English and one gentleman, I forgot the name, has done  
Tirumandiram, all the 3000 verses. Saiva Canons, all put together come to  
about 16000 verses.   
Arunachala Siva.

Vedas speak of the Brahman alone, all the Gods and Goddesses only signify the  
attributes of the Brahman alone which is only One. For eg. Siva means  
Auspiciousness Vishnu means All pervading, Shakti is force or energy etc..   
Vedas speak of this Brahman alone! so do even the works in Tamil. in Saiva  
Margas, Siva and Brahman are one and the same - Brahman

Vedas speak about various detiies, including natural forces like   
sun, moon, air, agni, water and the space. Siva means Agni or   
Effulgence. Vishnu means one who is all pervading. In Sri Rudram,   
one chapter starts as Agno-Vishnu, one who is effulgence and is all   
pervading. The Sandhya Vandhana mantras include prayer to one   
who is three eyed and long locked, (Siva) and one who is black   
and with red eyes and wearing golden robe, (peetambaram). Vedas   
have held Siva and Vishnu as the same deity. They also call it   
Brahman. The differentiations and intra-fights came much after   
Sri Ramanuja.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Re:[7]ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ  To whom vedas speaks ?

Dear all,   
Some historians believe that the figure of Shiva as we know him today was  
built up over time, with the ideas of many regional sects being amalgamated  
into a single figure.   
Shiva as we know him today shares many features with the Vedic god Rudra,and  
**both Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in a number of Hindu  
traditions.**   
Rudra, the god of the roaring storm, is usually portrayed in accordance with  
the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity.   
Furthermore, the Rudram, one of the most sacred hymns of Hinduism found both  
in the Rig and the Yajur Vedas and addressed to Rudra, invokes him as Shiva in  
several instances, but the term Shiva is used as a epithet for Indra, Mitra  
and Agni many times.   
 **The identification of Shiva with the older god Rudra is not universally  
accepted, as Axel Michaels explains:**   
Quote  
To what extent Śiva's origins are in fact to be sought in Rudra is extremely  
unclear. The tendency to consider Śiva an ancient god is based on this  
identification, even though the facts that justify such a far-reaching  
assumption are meager.  
 **In the Rigveda, Vishnu is mentioned 93 times.** He is frequently invoked  
alongside other deities, especially Indra, who he helps in killing Vritra, and  
with whom he drinks Soma.   
In the Mahabharata, Shiva is depicted as "the standard of invincibility,  
might, and terror", as well as a figure of honor, delight, and brilliance.The  
duality of Shiva's fearful and auspicious attributes appears in contrasted  
names.   
During the Vedic period, both Vishnu and Shiva (as identified with Rudra)  
played relatively minor roles, but by the time of the Brahmanas (c. 1000-700  
BCE), both were gaining ascendance.   
The 'Vishnu Sukta' of the Rig Veda (1.154) says that the first and second of  
Vishnu's strides (those encompassing the earth and air) are visible to men and  
the third is in the heights of heaven (sky). This last place is described as  
Vishnu's supreme abode in RV 1.22.20: Quote  
The princes evermore behold / that loftiest place where Visnu is / Laid as it  
were an eye in heaven. (trans. Griffith)  
Vishnu is more than a mere companion, equal in rank or power to Indra, or  
sometime the one who made Indra's success possible.
