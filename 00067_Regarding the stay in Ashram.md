Hi Karthik, from what i experienced from my stay in May 2006, i'm in the US  
and had to send an email to the the Ashram manager through their site, and he  
just replied back saying the stay was confirmed, and that's it..went there and  
signed in and got the room for 2 people..you have to let them know who it is  
so they can provide the bed arrangements likewise. There are absolutely no  
fees, but i made some donations which is appropriate to make since the ashram  
runs solely on donations. The stay was extremely pleasant, and the ashram food  
is heavenly. All the best!!

The current Ramanasramam policy is that visitors should write in advance of  
their proposed stay and get written or emailed confirmation of their booking.  
People who have not visited the ashram before are not usually granted the  
privilege of long stays. No money is charged for accommodation or food, but  
the ashram will happily accept donations from visitors to cover the cost of  
their stay.   
The ashram accommodation is to some extent zoned: single men in one area,  
couples in another, and so on. If you are a single woman in your 40s, you are  
likely to end up in 'K' block, a two-storey building in the main ashram  
compound that is usually occupied by single women of your age.   
I hope you enjoy your stay!
