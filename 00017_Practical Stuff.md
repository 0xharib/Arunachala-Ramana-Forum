I am rather surprised to find this section empty. i guess it is intimidating  
supposing that one can add anything to teachings based on the direct  
experience of someone like Ramana, without having fully experienced the same  
oneself. But I think it is very useful for one to discuss these concepts, in  
order to stimulate the integration of these concepts into the consciousness of  
the individual. Not that the concept is the goal. In Ramana's teaching, one  
uses questioning in order to free oneself of false concepts about who we  
really are. In the end, what is left is not a concept, but freedom from the  
false assumptions which we usually function under. It is like the old analogy  
of peeling away the layers of an onion until there is nothing left. So what  
we are doing is de-conditioning ourselves, so that we may experience reality  
as it really is, without adding anything to it.   
 Very important in this process is freeing ourselves of the desire for a  
result. If you are trying to achieve some enlightenment, then you do not yet  
realize that there is not anything to achieve. You are already that, and to  
desire some experience or realization is just another obstacle to seeing the  
truth.   
Notice if you lose awareness of the relaxation in the pit of your stomach.  
Whenever we are reaching for something, it will always express itself as  
tension there.   
Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak of these things here, since I am  
just a random nobody and this is the official site of Ramana's ashram. But  
this is an open forum, and I am certain Ramana would forgive any inadvertent  
misunderstandings and heresies.

Sorry. I guess I either lost track of where I was following all the links, or  
I simply misunderstood. In any case, congratulations on an excellent site.

Dear Dedhed,   
Ramana's teaching is not about how to free oneself from the false self  
concept.   
Vichara is about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an  
harmonious life.   
At the right moment the satguru will show up and give you the right treatment  
so that your enlightenment will occur at the predestined moment. Nothing can  
change that very moment.   
It is not insight/understanding but the complete burning away of your vasanas  
together with the work of the satguru that will free you.   
Having a desire for enlightenment or not will not affect the moment of freedom  
at all. It will only have an effect on your peace of mind.   
"To loose awareness" as you write is a strange expression in Advaita.  
Awareness is what is always there.

Dear devotee: I agree with you saying that our Guru Bhagavan Sri Ramana  
Maharshi has recommended us to get rid of the false concepts that keep us far  
from being aware of our true Self. But I also agree with Hameed: "Vichara is  
about being engaged in activities that are helpful to live an harmonious  
life." You both are helping all of us to better understand our Guru's  
teachings. Thanks!   
Well, I would like to know which are the ways that our Guru uses to  
communicate with His devotees, if any. I am specialy interested in this matter  
and would appreciate any help all of you can do. Yours in Bhagavans' grace,  
Sebastian.

Dear Sebastian, It is tricky to speak about Sri Ramana as one's Guru. Bhagavan  
merged with the Absolute in 1950. To the few disciples whose satguru He was at  
that moment he remained the guide. Apart from those blessed souls no one has  
ever heard or seen Him. The Bhagavan you refer to as your guru, is a  
projection of your mind and takes place only within your imagination. There is  
nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that this Ramana is your personal  
creation and thus not perfect. He reflects the maturity of your own sadhana.   
A real Guru is Love and it is this Love that is the teaching. His Love removes  
your fear and thus allows freedom, the freedom you need to dump false  
concepts. In this freedom you can recognize your own wisdom. A Guru can teach  
you nothing that you do not know already.   
Namaste

Dear Hameed, How can you know that when I say that Ramana is my guru I am only  
expressing a projection of my mind that takes place only within my  
imagination?!   
I feel it unreal to limit the actions of this great soul to only one  
encarnation, and, what is worse, limit the number of beings that can receive  
His sacred orientation! Remember that Bhagavan has said that He would stay  
forever at Arunachala. And Arunachala is not a paralyzed fenomenum, but has  
got the energy and grace that so many great beings, including Sri Ramana have  
sparkled over that mountain and flow to all directions on this planet! If, as  
you affirm, Bhagavans' direct influence is not available for the sincere  
seeker that practices the Yogas (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti), I see no reason to  
continue studying His teachings and receiving His messages and books! No! you  
must be an obstinated and intelligent student, but Bhagavan's teachings of  
Love and Wisdom shows that HE WAS, IS AND FOREVER WILL BE CLOSE TO ALL THE  
SINCERE DEVOTEES, NOT ONLY TO A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PRIVILEGED PERSONS!  
NO!   
Arunachala akshara Ramanala!   
With all my heart, yours in Bhagavans' grace, Sebastian.

Everybody has the right to worship the Self as Rama, Krishna, Buddha Jezus or  
Ramana. Do as you like but Jnana is not Bhakti.

Ramana said the Guru is the SELF.   
All that exists is the SELF.   
Its not the EGO that resonds when you nees help it is the SELF.   
Everything is within.   
The whole of the percieved world is no more than a picture within the SELF.   
Words and the thinking process deal with duality

That's really a good question Nandu. But, why do you not read the previous  
postings on this topic?   
Thousands believe Ramana is their guru. But it is just a belief, a concept.  
Bhagavan left his body in 1950 and apart from the few discipels whose satguru  
he was, nobody has seen him again. The people who claim guidance, visions etc.  
from Bhagavan are not more special than the devotees who get guidance, visions  
etc. from Jesus, Krishna or Rama. In other words, Like in their dreams, these  
people project all these heavenly Masters within their imagination and like in  
dreams they experience their own projections as real.   
Since they are not perfect beings, also their projected gurus are imperfect  
beings. If they speak wisdom, it is usually from the devotees' own uncouscious  
memory.   
Their heavenly "satgurus" are sometimes totally unreliable and unpredictable.  
Never blame Jesus, Krishna or Ramana for the crap and nonsense these people  
tend to produce.

Dear all,   
I have just come across this discussion about whether Bhagavan is a guru or  
not. I don't understand how one can limit Him to the body that left in 1950.  
He is the very Satguru, the very essence of Being that is in all of us, He  
goes by the name of Rama, Jesus, Allah, etc. He has not gone anywhere, He is  
there as always, ever ready to guide you and shower His Grace on whoever  
turns to Him. He alone IS!   
Yours in Bhagavan,   
Sharada

Dear Sharada,   
You are perfectly right. So many people limit Sri Ramana to the body and think  
he sits on a bench somewhere in Heaven continuing his work as satguru.   
Of course it is all nonsense. Satgurus have one to five disciples at one time  
to whom he is the satguru, in other words people whom he guides towards  
certain enlightenment. He is monitoring their minds all the time, round the  
clock. Scolding, beating and guiding them. Even when he leaves the body he  
will continue his guidance but only to the ones whose satguru he was while in  
the body.   
All people who later claim Ramana is the satguru, foster just a belief, like  
Jesus died for my sins, Islam is the only way to salvation etc.   
Ramana merged with the Absolute and like any soul has no physical limits  
anymore. As long as there is Ego in a devotee, the selfless nature of Ramana's  
boundless love cannot be experienced.   
Above is no different from the teachings of Bhagavan Himself and is a pointer  
towards the Truth.

ALL IS ONE !!! (also a booklet ISBN 81-88018-40-6; Sri Ramanaasramam)   
 **The true Guru - Satguru - resides within the lotus of your heart, the  
centre of the Self.**   
When the Jiva/Soul is ripe and ready, Self/God/Guru will project or manifest  
Itself in a physical form (embodied or dis-embodied) if that form is easier to  
accept by the particular Soul. The manifestation of Self in the form of a  
physical Guru will guide the Soul to the Ultimate Truth by pushing from the  
outside, while the inner Guru will pull from the inside (figuratively  
speaking) back into it's origin of the centre or heart.   
The Guru can take any form and appearance that is the most conductive for that  
Soul to achieve the Ultimate goal of waking up the Soul to the Truth and  
eliminating the illusion of Ego by devouring the individual personality/Ego.   
Only the Soul in question can identify it's own true Guru by the effect that  
manifestation has upon the individual.   
Utmost importance is the willingness of the Soul to allow that, the mind/ego  
will try to run from it's elimination and trick the individual in various ways  
in order to survive. Old habits die hard and the mind tends to hang onto it's  
old incorrect conditioning, desires and perceptions. To realise the Ultimate  
Reality/Truth, all the conditioning of perceiving the Relative Reality as only  
Reality, has to be eliminated. This process is ruthless, harsh and usually  
experienced as unpleasant to the mind. It rips of layer after layer of that  
personality ego and crushes the misconceptions of the mind into a powder and  
dust to be swept away by the winds of change. The severity of this process is  
determined by the ridgety or flexibility of the ego personality.   
To this end, UTTER and TOTAL surrender has to be given to the Self/God/Guru,  
that arises from a relationship of complete Love and Trust. One can only  
accept such processes because out of utter Love and Trust - be that to God,  
Guru or Universal Consciousness - it doesn't matter at all what IT is called.  
A name is just a concept. That LOVE or Devotion is called "Bhakti" and has to  
precede the fruit of "Jnana" or Wisdom/Knowledge. If there is nothing or no  
one to Love or Trust, the Ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction of the ego  
personality is extremely hard to follow through.   
Bhakti without Jnana is blind, but Jnana without Bhakti is lame. They are two  
sides of one and the same coin and go hand in hand.   
Until the state of "ONE", non-duality has been established, duality has to be  
utilised to arrive at the realisation of the truth. Then, there is NO-THING  
that has attributes of duality or anything for that matter. Just perfect  
Consciousness - Awareness of an Emptiness that is perfect Fullness at the same  
time - mind can not grasp it - words can not describe it, no concept can even  
come close to it.   
You - me, the words you're reading, the screen it appears upon, the  
electricity that enables it to work, the air you breathe and the mind that  
thinks right now - ALL THAT IS - IS ONE - is Ramana, Christ, Krishna any name  
, any form - available to anyone at anytime. Anything perfect and anything  
imperfect, is ONE Consciousness - one Energy, playing a Divine Lila - a drama  
on Itself as the stage, about Itself, with Itself, watching Itself, applauding  
Itself. Where does the air of the bedroom end and the air of the lounge room  
start? Is the air I'm breathing separate from the air you're breathing? Where  
does it separate? It's all one air - no gaps or separations.   
And It is all there, NOW perfectly manifest in you, me and anyone (apparent)  
else. The ONLY thing that separates us (also apparently) from being Aware of  
the Reality/Truth/Consciousness is the veil the ego/mind personality has  
thrown over our understanding. Still the mind, stop it's chatter, trick it by  
asking "Who am I ?, Where am I ? WHAT am I ? Who is thinking this thought ?  
Where does it come from ?. Eventually, the mind will give up and retrieve  
into it's source, first briefly, gradually staying there a little longer until  
one fine day, in a random act of Grace, the Inner Guru/Self will devour it  
completely and the Truth will be established.   
In the meantime, there is no right, there is no wrong, only different  
perceptions. One thousand people - one thousand Pathways - no right path or  
wrong path - actually, there is NO path at all. There is NOWHERE to go to or  
arrive at, we're already there. Once we stop chasing enlightment (what one  
chases is usually running ahead and away), once we stop "seeking", we might  
find "THAT" already HERE and NOW and we/it just IS.   
Love and Wisdom to all   
Premanjali

so many stories of gurus. ..... so little time   
i see the things that Ramana said not as teachings, but as an invitation (  
for those who are ready ) to investigate the self. this simply means to face  
the fear of death which is at the root of the avoidance of truth.
