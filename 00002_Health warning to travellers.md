Visitors to Tiruvannamalai and to India in general should be aware of the  
current epidemics and health dangers that are prevalent today.   
There are a number of mosquito-borne diseases that are gaining ground over the  
efforts to contain them.   
1/ Chikun Kunya/Gunya   
This is a very debilitating disease now spreading throughout India. The  
symptoms are a very high fever of 105/106 farenheight, painful or itching body  
rash and severe pain in the joints.   
This virus is self-limiting, lasting about 15 days, but the after-effects can  
last for months or years.   
2/ Dengue fever   
This is a far more serious illness, which if not treated properly, can lead to  
hemorrhagic fever and death. The symptoms are almost the same as for chikun  
kunya.   
You can find details of this disease on the web.   
3/ Malaria   
This is becoming very widespread throughout Tamil Nadu. There are hundreds of  
new cases in Tiruvannamalai every year.   
If caught quickly there are allopathic medicines which can destroy the  
parasite, but they are very toxic to the body. There are also herbal remedies  
which work perfectly and have no side-effects.

Thank you for the warning message Graham.   
At certain times of the day and night, the mosquitos literally appear in  
little "clouds" \- you might think they try to carry you away However, I  
found a local mosiquito repellent product (after arriving in Tiruvannamalai  
without one), excellent to keep the little pests away from the skin. It's  
called "Odomos", comes in cream form, and works like a charm. It's available  
at most shops and pharmacies in India. Prevention is the best medicine they  
say

Dr. Manickam, a herbal practitioner in Tiruvannamalai has a 100% herbal cure  
for malaria. It was created by his father and Bhagavan during the Virupaksha  
days.   
This is the text from the 'news and articles/a cure for malaria' page on this  
site -   
A cure for malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases   
Dr Manickam, has recently produced a large quantity of an old herbal cure  
which destroys the malarial parasite and cleanses the body of all malarial  
cysts. This medicine, if taken for sixteen days is also reputed to provide  
immunity against the parasite.   
Recently it has been given to people suffering from the effects of the chikun  
gunya virus; the pain associated with this disease vanishes completely upon  
taking the medication for just a few days.   
This herbal recipe was created by Dr Manickam's father in consultation with  
Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi over 70 years ago. It was formulated and given to  
those staying at Sri Ramana's ashram with complete success. That this herbal  
recipe was created by one of India's greatest sages gives it the mark of  
perfection and complete safety.   
The recipe consists of parts from 13 different plants, resins, bark and  
flowers, some are well-known and others are secret extracts known only to his  
family. The plants are dried and crushed to a fine powder. The powders are  
then mixed in precise quantities to produce a remedy that is simply mixed with  
water, boiled and reduced to 50%, then strained and drunk. This cure has no  
side-effects, is completely wholesome and is 100% effective, even against old  
malaria.   
The good doctor wants this cure to be available worldwide - at the lowest  
possible cost wherever possible. He is aware of the difficulties surrounding  
the current delivery method and is willing to talk to Indian pharmaceutical  
companies about the possibility of synthesizing this medication for use  
throughout the world. However, any pharmaceutical companies approaching him  
should have a track-record of service, otherwise they will be refused.   
Dr. Manickam is now dispensing this medication free-of-charge to the local  
village populace who cannot afford to pay for it, but cannot afford to give it  
free to everyone.

Bhagavan, and Ayurvedic medicine click here - 207kb

## Re:[4]Open tuberculosis in Arunachala?

I have just received an email from someone in Thiru, saying that open TBC is  
spreading wild and fast, and that there have been several cases in the Ashram  
lately. I was planning to visit in a month's time, but now I'm really  
concerned about this, especially as I am pregnant. Does anyone have more  
information?   
Thank you so much

Hi Musgrave,   
Tuberculosis is common in India, but diagnosis is often guesswork, especially  
in rural areas where anyone with a persistent cough is diagnosed with TB or  
AIDS just by looking at them. You should not worry yourself too much about  
this.   
There are 100% cures available in India from the reputable herbal and siddha  
practitioners - whatever the strain of infection.
