Hello José, here is a link to some books in French: http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/   
Select the download menu.   
Here is link for English material: http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/Allpub.html   
The Reminiscences of Sri Ramana Maharshi section is helpful.   
Other books.   
The Teachings of Ramana Maharshi, edited by Arthur Osborne.   
The path of Sri Ramana by Sri Sadhu Om.   
The link posted by Mick Hutchinson of video footage is well worth watching: http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-4070950622029595051&q=ramana+maharishi&total=24&start=0&num=10&so=0&type=search&plindex=0
