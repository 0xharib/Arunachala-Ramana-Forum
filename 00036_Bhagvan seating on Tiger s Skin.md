## Bhagvan seating on Tiger's Skin

All,   
I noticed in the photos that Bhagvan is seating on several different Tigers'  
skins. Can you please give me historical background about it or explanations  
Bhagvan might have given. I am sure someone might have pointed it out then and  
might have asked about it Appaently, it seems the violation of non-violence  
rule but again, that is from our (ignorant) point of view. There is no such  
thing as violence or non-violence for Jnani. However, Jnani sets an exemple  
for us - a-jnani and I am only seeking an answer.   
Bowing to Bhagvan,   
Urmish

I think it is the Hindu traditional belief that only the enlightened One can  
sit for meditation on the skin of a ferocious predator whose vibs are still in  
the skin. Disciples show up with such skins out of respect and the Sage sits  
on it if it helps to foster others' devotion.

Now, that is a perfectly acceptable explanation..however it leads to another  
question...How can I strenthen my devotion to Bhagvan?

Through devotion and humility. Do not fall into the trap that you have a  
special relationship with him, that he is the satguru etc. He is not.

In that case, who is he and what will latch me to devotion? In other words, it  
sounds great to say he is not related to you and he won't do nothing etc but  
that kind of outlook fails in stirring devotion, interest (even to have or  
maintain virtues like humility.)   
I am not attacking your statement or a view, I am simply prolonging a  
dialogue.

@ Urmish Mehta: I too once asked this question about the tiger skin. But the  
thought did occur to me that maybe the tiger died from old age or disease. And  
that a devotee perhaps wanted to use the head and skin as something  
functional; as a good quality (even stylish ) rug for Ramana to sit and  
meditate on. The image may deceive our mind and suggest a violent act  
occurred against the tiger, but this may have not been the case.
