Namaskar,   
I am planning to visit Shri Ramanaashram by third week of October. Can some  
body guide me about the exact loaction of Ashram int the town, so it will be  
easy for me to get down accordingly. I will be coming from Chennai by bus.  
Also can accommodation be booked for single in advance at Ashram ?   
Ulhas Sathaye

It is very easy to find the ashram - any rickshaw will happily take you, for  
a ride, for too many rupees, when you first arrive! But from the bus station  
it would cost about thirty rupees and even if they ask more it is very little  
in Western money. The final stop for the Chennai bus will be the bus station  
in Tiru.   
You HAVE to book ashram accomodation in advance - 3-6 months for the winter  
season, as it becomes very busy here. If you have not booked try e-mailing  
right away and then see what happens. If they still have rooms you may be  
lucky.   
Good Luck,   
Regulus

Ramanashramam is a serene place where spiritual halo of Sri Ramana is very  
much obvious. Rank materialists get converted into godly beings there.  
Ramana' potent presence simply transforms you.
