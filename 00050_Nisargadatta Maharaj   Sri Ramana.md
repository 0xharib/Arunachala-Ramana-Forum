Nisargadatta Maharaj & Sri Ramana were the two big spiritual guns of twentieth  
century. How do they compare themselves with each other ? I mean in stature,  
teachings and levels of realization.

Bhagavan once told Narayana Iyer, 'There are no jnanis. Jnana alone is'. If  
you are a jnani, you don't see anyone as either enlightened or unenlightened.  
You simply abide as the Self. The idea that some beings are more enlightened  
than others only exists for people who think that they are unenlightened.   
 I have heard that Nisargadatta had the utmost respect for Bhagavan. As for  
Bhagavan, he didn't see anything as other than his own Self, and he certainly  
never graded people as being more or less enlightened than himself.

Dear Ramana Follower,   
It is difficult to compare two realized souls,except in terms of  
empirical/physical matters such as their height,weight, time and year of birth  
and so onsuch info is anyway useless.As for the teachings there could be  
small differences and approaches mainly due to different times and environment  
of the gurus and the limitation of the language used.   
As for me, both the jnanis cared for their devotees one living inthe heart  
of Mumbai and another in a small temple town but close to Chennai[madras] a  
large city.They did not retire to forest or in the caves of the  
Himalayas...How fortunate were those thousands of devotees who thronged them--  
including my father who had visited Ramana several times and received their  
Grace!

Perhaps, Raju Balsekhar (Refer: Advaita, Buddha and the Unbroken   
Whole, Zen Publications, Mumbai) has read in detail about both   
Ramana and Nisargadutta Maharaj. He kept a picture of Bhagavan,   
in his study above his desk. He says that both are realized souls and   
guides for humanity. What I feel is that Bhagavan realized the Self,   
and then came to Arunachala to practise "tapas" for the sake of   
devotees and heard and read, and wrote books, again for the sake of devotees.  
In the case of Nisarga Dutta Maharaj, it was the usual order   
reading, tapas and realization.
