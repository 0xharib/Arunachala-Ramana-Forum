What is that state in which the 'I' conciousness merges with the universal  
cosciousness and still one is aware of the body and everything that is going  
on around him?

That state would be called 'Savikalpa samadhi" in Vedanta literature...when  
one is not conscious of one's body, it is called 'Nirvikalpa samadhi'   
Both are temporary states and one returns to normal consciousness.

The "I consciousness, is the state of living with the mind, and   
with that the intellect, mind-stuff (chit) and ego. All of us   
are living with our minds and Bhagavan says that we have to   
bring it to single monotone of praying to some God. This is   
called mano-layam. Then one can try the destruction of the   
mind, mano-nasa. When this occurs, we become One with the   
Brahman, where there is no two but only one. In my personal   
case, I tried it on a few occasions, and with "some bliss", I developed   
immense fear and I chanted Arunachala-Siva, a number of times   
to get back to my normal stupid self! This is the experience of   
many others who had reported this to Bhagavan. Perhaps, we   
are not yet ready.

It's easy to get scared, it's the total destruction of everything.   
You have to let go and not care about life of death.   
You get to the brink and run away !!!!!!!   
I've jumped up and run around, it's so stupid.   
Mentally you know you should think !!   
Just have to surrender, let go, don't panic [ LOL !!!!]   
You got to see the funny side of it !!!   
Being scared of being youreself !!   
Got to keep at it !!   
It's much worse to come back to another body, believe that you are somebody  
completely different and go through another load of and die all over  
again and be born again and go through the same all over again  
eeeech !!!   
With any luck I might come back as a potatoe next time !!   
I mean who ever saw a potatoe with any troubles of cares !!

Dear mick, I agree with you. Fear of death is the primordial fear   
for every living being. This is fear of the unknown. Death is   
a relief but fearing about death is a pain. The psychiatrists say   
that fear of one losing is his mind (becoming a psychoneuratic or   
a psychoic) comes from the fear of death. Fear about the death   
is the hump on the way towards self-realization. If one could overcome   
this, the goal is reached. Arunachala Siva.

If you look at it, the real cause of fear of death or annihilation is due to  
our identification with the body. Once the knowledge that we are not our body  
(the body has come out of the five elements of nature and has to go back  
sometime, and what is really you is that which temporarily inhabits or  
possesses the body and always continues to exist) dawns, only then can we  
permanently get rid of this root fear. Hence I feel true assimilation of this  
knowledge of "who am I really" is the only means to clear our "I"  
consiousness.

Dear mmohan,   
Very correct. What is death? Is death a known factor? No.   
Even the dead do not come back and tell us what it is. It   
is, on the contrary, the fear of losing the known. We are   
afraid to lose our mind-body complex, which is quite dear   
to us. If one develops courage not to fear about death,   
which is, nonetheless not known to anyone in this world,   
half the battle is won.   
Arunachala Siva.
