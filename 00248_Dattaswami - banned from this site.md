Dattaswami has been banned from this site because he broke the rules and is  
clearly on a campaign of self-promotion - which goes against everything that  
this site is about.   
I took the decision to remove everything posted by him and all replies, but  
only after reading some of the rubbish he posted.   
This is irreversible.   
I must apologise for not acting sooner.

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I stopped visiting this site after Dattaswami  
hijacked it. Now I might return once in a while.

If anything like this happens again, then all members please inform me by  
mailing me.   
I am not a censor, but Dattaswami's kind of conduct will not be tolerated in  
future.
