In normal life, having dissatisfaction in work, makes people to think deeply  
and leads to do the work perfectly. In the same way in spiritual life   
this type of dissatisfaction is good or bad? Or it is not good to expect  
anything in spiritual life.

It is all process of the grinding that is happenning. just dont worry about  
these. There is no point in controlling ones feeling be it satisfaction or  
dissatisfaction. If we are dissatisfied, it is so happenning because of our  
prarabdha. what is the point in telling/consoling ourselves by saying to  
ourselves "dont be dissatisfied"   
One has to eat chillies to know the taste of chillies. and once when we have  
eaten it, we have to carry on by drinking water to ease the tongue, similarly,  
by remembering the Self or God or mananam or smaranam etc...   
I just feel, it all happens accordigly, there is no free will at all. our only  
free will is to go towards the Self, meanwhile the Prarabdha will carry on,  
satisfaction dissatisfaction etc...   
Just Be, Silent, Letr what happen happen... Lets move on (towads) the Self   
Salutatrions to Sri Ramana

Dear ramanaduli,   
I agree with Nagaraj. Bhagavan Ramana says Kuraiyum gunmmum nee anral, ennen   
ivatrai ennuyire ennam adhuvo adhu sevyai, kanne un than kazhal inaiyil kadhal   
perukke tharuvaye....   
I am not worried about my inadequacies or completeness. You do whatever you  
want.   
But give me abundant love for your anklet wearing feet. Love to God helps us  
to   
transcend all dyads.   
Arunachala Siva.
