Hello,   
I'm curently reading a publication intituled MAHA YOGA, edition 2002.   
p65 of this publication it is said about dreams: "The dream world appears real while the dream lasts; if in the dream, the  
dreamer doubt the reality of what he sees and tries to find out the truth, he  
always concludes, not that he is dreaming, but that he is wide awake. In fact  
nature never allows any one to go on dreaming and at the same time know that  
he is dreaming"   
Despite of these assertion, the FACT is that sometimes I DO CONSCIOUS DREAMS.  
It always happend at the beginning of a dream and it is a very real, full and  
happy experience. I'm also able to modify the dream, for exemple, to change  
the landscape. It is to be noticed that it happends when my mind is very quiet  
during the evening.   
So I don't understand why the assertion is made that "the nature never allows  
any one to go on dreamings and at the same time know that he is dreaming" ?   
Don't you think that the fact that we can be conscious of a dream is somewhere  
linked to the same processus that the processus to see the world (the real  
world") as it is realy ?

The dream lasts as long as the body lives. but who is not dreaming? the  
witness of the dream while it is being dreamt. Awareness.

Hi,   
I recently noticed an article in the Discovery magazine which said to the  
effect that researchers have found some evidence that our normal waking state  
and the dreaming state share some identical properties. As to the assertion in  
your mentioned book I also disagree having also had some conscious awareness  
at the beginnings of some dreams and could direct them for a short period.  
Very cool! In short, I agree. It would appear that science and experience show  
that the normal waking state and the dream state are closer related than most  
of us realize.   
Mut

Everybody has, at some time or the other, consciousness about being in a  
dream, even the ability to slightly modify it. But that does not mean that we  
are conscious all the time of being in a dream. What is meant in the text is  
just that. We cannot, for example decide that we want to dream and stage-  
manage the whole show. Having flashes of consciousness in dreams is just like  
having flashes of transcendental consciousness in the waking state. These go  
as they come, as Bhagavan has said. Only what is permanent is useful.   
Yours in Bhagavan,   
Sharada
