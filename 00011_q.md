## REASON FOR THE WAY OF THINGS

I got this idea from repeatedly reading instructions to Sivarakasam Pillai.   
Why are things the way they are?   
If all that exists is ONE,   
If you divide ONE you get TWO,   
Divide again FOUR   
And again EIGHT.   
And so on.   
So this means that numbers and mathematics were NOT CREATED!!   
They are just a simple fact of the nature of reality!   
From this we might deduce that all of matter and the very existence of the  
Universe and all its laws are the same.   
No matter many universes there might be, no matter how many sub-atomic  
particles are found, they are ALL are result of the division of ONE. And the  
ONE is ALL!   
So all that exists is the nature of REALITY, uncreated, eternal unchanging and  
unchangeable!!

ALSO   
Another concept which seems to explain existence.   
What would exixts if nithing at all existed?   
No stars no planets.   
No matter.   
No space.   
No time.   
A VOID, in which there was nothing.   
Well the VOID would still exist!!   
Therefore EXISTENCE IS!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
I mean what would there be if there was non exixtence?   
There is no such thing as non being!   
One cannot even concieve of non exixstence.   
I dont mean the non existence of the material Universes ~~.   
............................................................   
And as consciousness is known to be.   
Then consciuosness is what IS!!   
Nothing could exist if there was not anything to be consciuos of it!   
Only consciuosness exists!~~

1;All over the world people fight and kill each other for conflicting  
ideologies.   
Crazy ideas about the nature of God and the nature of reality.   
2;The computer with which we comunicate and the science tha created it are  
part of the investigation into the nature of physical reality.   
Surley it must be right to have concepts on the mental plane which get as near  
as is possible to the truth, rather than some of the ideas which are around  
,which are close to complete madness.   
The constant refining and updating of the mental and verbal ideas to get them  
closer to the Ultimate Truth must surely be a good thing? And might help  
others who follow the path. Isnt this just what all books on this subject do?   
Peace!!!

Books after all are views....ideologies are mine, yours and theirs...Baghvan  
was many times asked/ hinted why He is so quite when all of India was burning.  
His answer was always the same...improve our own attitude.   
Research into Religion, nature of God, heaven and hell has not made us any  
better. As on Dec 2006, the scientist are trying to solve BIG BANG. Concept  
is a thought. Imagine the whole world in deep sleep...then during that  
sleep....there is no world...a concept isn't it. So very temporary.   
I am who I am... all the refining and updating on mental plane leaves me  
stranded. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni was a refined man...well versed in all that  
books had to offer, yet he knew something was not right. And he got his  
answer.   
I can help a blind person to cross the road.... I surely cannot help if he  
blames the whole world for his darkness.   
I have to change my attitude...I have to unlearn and start all over  
again....and for this I need lot of LOVE and Faith... Bhakti...Devotion...

I suggest you have a look at David Godmans book "Be as you are"   
You wil see that Ramana always answered sincere questions intelligently and  
lucidly.   
And he used metaphors from the modern world!! For instance his likening of the  
percieved world to the picture on a movie screen and saying that it is like  
the audience AND the actors being on the screen simultaneously !! Look at his  
replies to al the questions about the nature of things.   
You yourself are using thought to comunicate and are constantly forming  
concepts as you relate to material life.   
Everything has its place and what might loosely be called purpose.Without the  
process of conceptualisation you wouldnt know anything at all !!   
If you look at the world around you its possible to see, in a quite practical  
way that it is a picture WITHIN you. As Ramana said there is no inside and  
outside for the self. Certain psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD cause  
perception of the world to be distorted, making it plain that what we percieve  
to be the world is no more than a picture within us ! My one experience of  
Nirvikapala Samadhi and the Kundalini was in 1971 on LSD.   
So these statements that the world isnt real are actualy true!! In the sense  
that what we percieve as the world is, I qoute Ramana, "cordinated sense  
impressions",   
The picture of the world is created from cordinated sense impressions. The  
qualities that we experience, pleasant, bad, good, nice nasty, these are all  
the mind. Astral energy made from Sat Chit Ananda. The division [apparent ] of  
the Self into Duality gives rise to the mind and all its machinations. So I  
observe this within, in daily life. I recognise the process of mind as much as  
I am able.   
The mind is nescessary otherwise no forward progress is possible.   
Improve your attitude ? Knowing the truth at all levels possible IS improving  
your attitude!   
Peace   
Mick!!!

. ..Hello Mick   
There is no conflict...only varied interpretation. It used to happen right in  
front of Baghavan.   
Did I reject concepts...I dont think so. I am attempting to separate the ego I  
from the concepts...Yes I agree the world will be as long as there is  
impressions and concepts. Statements that world is untrue are statements...  
when the untruth is preceived, no statement will be necessary.   
To me Baghvan is silence...   
As Ramana says..mind turned inwards is pure and pure mind is Atma or truth  
...whatever the name is...   
And only by improving the attitude will lead me to truth at all levels or for  
that matter beyond levels..turiyattita.   
Till that time I need mind to improve my mind, material mind has to unlearn  
and turn within.   
Yours In Baghvan

Thats right. its what I meant.   
Varied interpretation, different interpretations suit different personalities.  
It must be a good thing if things can be seen to make sense!   
For me Ramana was/is the greatest guru of all time.   
Silence is hard to achieve.   
I get it that the I thought isnt the self, that if the I thought is a thought  
then there would seem to have to be an experiencer of the I thought. Also that  
this experiencer isnt real, it doesent exist. I sort of get it. I guess thats  
the limit of where the mind can go!   
But I do try!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding.

No Mick. ...havent seen the film...will when i get the chance.   
I am almost on a flight to Lagos and waiting at the lounge with Nan Yar in my  
pocket....well you started the thread and it was good. So here I am checking  
out what you had to say next...I am reading question 21 of the dialogue..   
Sivaprakasam Pillai : Is enquiry into scriptural teaching necessary for an  
earnest seeker ?   
Bagahvan : As there is no use in analysing the garbage collected, so it is  
with an earnest seeker who is searching for his-self,.There is no use for a  
person who wants to understand his -self, instead of discarding the ignorance  
that hides his- self, does research on his-self. This prapancham...crudely  
translated in English as "world " . .. ( for want of better description)  
should be perceived as a dream...   
Now then is it necessary for us to analyse nature of reality   
Swami Dayananda in his commentary on Upadesa Saram says...thoughts are of 2  
types. ..mechanical and purposeful....   
mechanical thoughts are destructive. ...so lets avoid mechanical thoughts....a  
mind over which there is no control is a monkey...   
In Baghvan

The post is ABOUT holding onto the perception of the world as a dream!!   
By realising that perception off the world is a picture manufactured by the  
mind out of cosciuossness.   
Thats why I started the post.   
I say to myself that is isnt real, that what Im seeing is an illusion. that  
the experiences that Ive had show me this.   
Otherwise I forget and start taking the ups and downs of material life  
seriously!!!   
And if I can get it into a more concise verbal form , or use a more modern  
metaphor it makes conversation with anyone else who is interested easier!!!!   
I talk for a living!!   
Peace, love and understanding

the truth is it takes energy to think thoughts, and silence requires no  
energy at all.   
if what you want is truth, you will not find it in reason. following  
thoughts leads away from truth.

Tell me did you think when you repllied to the post?   
How can there be a discusion forum without thoughts?   
Silence takes no enegy for Who?   
Strange how people here, instead of discusng the topic give wise advice. I  
wonder what is the cause of this?   
Be careful that you do not make a dogma out of what should be an honest quest  
.That is the way of religion, and look at all the trouble that causes!

AND   
Please correct me if Im wrong, but It seems to me that silence takes many  
,many lifetimes of effort and even with that effort it needs some grace too.   
Stetching around you the infinite Universe, living beings, seemingly without  
end and not many of them are Silent.   
Nor on this little planet, very very few have there ever ever been such as  
Ramana Mahirishi! Silence no effort for this great and compassionate being  
,but for a lowly being such as I its a big effort!!!!!!!

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

I notice that when someone went to Ramana with a philosohical question, like"  
why would God will this way? " Ramana ANSWERS THE QUESTION!!!. He doesnt make  
comments about the questioners LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT. Ramana  
does his best to answer the question.   
He doesnt see himself as some superior being looking down on the questioner.   
This is the real thing !!!!100% enlighened being, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   
No trying to get followers.   
No feeling of superiority.

If you divide ONE you get two, divide again, four and so on. This means that  
numbers [and the nature of all things] are the nature of reality.If the END  
and the BEGINING are merely facets[percieved] of the same ONE then cause and

If you divide ONE you get two, divide again, four and so on. This means that  
numbers [and the nature of all things] are the nature of reality.  
This does not make any sense to me at all. Numbers are a concept of the human  
mind. How could you prove the relavance of numbers and any equations,  
thoughts... _reALity_ even, without consciousness?   
Consciousness is the source of all...everything, infinity including  
perceptions of number and equation, but numbers are not the source of reality,  
infinity has no source for it is infinate, it simply _is_.

If the END and the BEGINING are merely facets[percieved] of the same ONE then  
cause and effect do not exist. I take it that cause and effect are what you  
mean by consequence!!

hmmm, yes, i was refering to consequence in the context of cause and effect,  
but i was stating that they are an illusion, which is similer to what you were  
saying. Cause and effect does exist within the illusionary realms of thought,  
but are irrelavant to the self.   
Beggining and end are also illusions of thought. How can you divide infinity?

What requirement does is'ness have for the words "ALL" and "ONE" except for  
the processing of thoughts which simply binds oneself from recognising the  
thought's source, that which IS...   
Perhaps one should focus their attention on the meaning of ALL aswell as  
ONENESS. ALL is infinity, this is why i asked earlier, _how can you divide  
infinity?_ All divisions are created by mathmatical concepts of the mind.

That which lies beyond the Primal Cause can only be experienced and not  
defined by words, call it division or whatever you like, these words are  
calculated and formed within the mind.

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

ALSO   
I notice that when someone went to Ramana with a philosohical question, like"  
why would God will this way? " Ramana ANSWERS THE QUESTION!!!. He doesnt make  
comments about the questioners LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT. Ramana  
does his best to answer the question.   
He doesnt see himself as some superior being looking down on the questioner.   
This is the real thing !!!!100% enlighened being, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   
No trying to get followers.   
No feeling of superiority.

exists is ONE. Existence itself cannot be dual. For this reason all that  
exists is the result of divsion!   
The SELF is SAT CHIT ANANDA. Divide it you get the Duality of subject and  
object. You get the Ego which percieves the Object [not really real though]  
and you get the objects percieved. The percieved qualities of the object the  
,ASTRAL aspect, result from the ANANDA aspect of the SELF.   
The EGO or imaginary "I", results from the Chit aspect of the SELF. When the  
duality ceases in SAMADHI The SELF is revealed as being only ONE.   
Everything fits together, everything is logical, everything makes sense.   
And ALL that exists is CONSCIUOSNESS   
And CONSCIUOSNESS is only ONE!   
And RAMANA was/is for me the Greatest, most wonerfull GURU of all.   
Everything he did.   
Every word he spoke.   
All examples of what we could/are/be.   
A shining light in the darkness of samsara!!   
A beacon!!!

What Im saying is ALL IS ONE. If ALL = one then if you divide ONE you get  
two, divide again four and so on. So numbers are not at all a product of the  
human mind they are the result of the division of ONE.  
What requirement does is'ness have for the words "ALL" and "ONE" except for  
the processing of thoughts which simply binds oneself from recognising the  
thought's source, that which IS...   
Perhaps one should focus their attention on the meaning of ALL aswell as  
ONENESS. ALL is infinity, this is why i asked earlier, _how can you divide  
infinity?_ All divisions are created by mathmatical concepts of the mind.

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

This does not make any sense to me at all. Numbers are a concept of the human  
mind. How could you prove the relavance of numbers and any equations,  
thoughts... _reALity_ even, without consciousness?   
Consciousness is the source of all...everything, infinity including  
perceptions of number and equation, but numbers are not the source of reality,  
infinity has no source for it is infinate, it simply _is_.

hmmm, yes, i was refering to consequence in the context of cause and effect,  
but i was stating that they are an illusion, which is similer to what you were  
saying. Cause and effect does exist within the illusionary realms of thought,  
but are irrelavant to the self.   
Beggining and end are also illusions of thought. How can you divide infinity?

What Im saying is ALL IS ONE. If ALL = one then if you divide ONE you get  
two, divide again four and so on. So numbers are not at all a product of the  
human mind they are the result of the division of ONE. All of the percieved  
Universe and everything that IS, is as a result of this [apparent] division  
.The human mind itself exists as a result of the divisoin of ONE. All that  
exists is ONE. Existence itself cannot be dual. For this reason all that  
exists is the result of divsion!   
The SELF is SAT CHIT ANANDA. Divide it you get the Duality of subject and  
object. You get the Ego which percieves the Object [not really real though]  
and you get the objects percieved. The percieved qualities of the object the  
,ASTRAL aspect, result from the ANANDA aspect of the SELF.   
The EGO or imaginary "I", results from the Chit aspect of the SELF. When the  
duality ceases in SAMADHI The SELF is revealed as being only ONE.   
Everything fits together, everything is logical, everything makes sense.   
And ALL that exists is CONSCIUOSNESS   
And CONSCIUOSNESS is only ONE!   
And RAMANA was/is for me the Greatest, most wonerfull GURU of all.   
Everything he did.   
Every word he spoke.   
All examples of what we could/are/be.   
A shining light in the darkness of samsara!!   
A beacon!!!

What requirement does is'ness have for the words "ALL" and "ONE" except for  
the processing of thoughts which simply binds oneself from recognising the  
thought's source, that which IS...   
Perhaps one should focus their attention on the meaning of ALL aswell as  
ONENESS. ALL is infinity, this is why i asked earlier, _how can you divide  
infinity?_ All divisions are created by mathmatical concepts of the mind.

calculated and formed within the mind.

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

ALSO   
I notice that when someone went to Ramana with a philosohical question, like"  
why would God will this way? " Ramana ANSWERS THE QUESTION!!!. He doesnt make  
comments about the questioners LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT. Ramana  
does his best to answer the question.   
He doesnt see himself as some superior being looking down on the questioner.   
This is the real thing !!!!100% enlighened being, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   
No trying to get followers.   
No feeling of superiority.

saying. Cause and effect does exist within the illusionary realms of thought,  
but are irrelavant to the self.   
Beggining and end are also illusions of thought. How can you divide infinity?  
(ha haaa yes, i'm aware that you are probably already thinking along these  
lines )   
Nell   
What Im saying is ALL IS ONE. If ALL = one then if you divide ONE you get  
two, divide again four and so on. So numbers are not at all a product of the  
human mind they are the result of the division of ONE. All of the percieved  
Universe and everything that IS, is as a result of this [apparent] division  
.The human mind itself exists as a result of the divisoin of ONE. All that  
exists is ONE. Existence itself cannot be dual. For this reason all that  
exists is the result of divsion!   
The SELF is SAT CHIT ANANDA. Divide it you get the Duality of subject and  
object. You get the Ego which percieves the Object [not really real though]  
and you get the objects percieved. The percieved qualities of the object the  
,ASTRAL aspect, result from the ANANDA aspect of the SELF.   
The EGO or imaginary "I", results from the Chit aspect of the SELF. When the  
duality ceases in SAMADHI The SELF is revealed as being only ONE.   
Everything fits together, everything is logical, everything makes sense.   
And ALL that exists is CONSCIUOSNESS   
And CONSCIUOSNESS is only ONE!   
And RAMANA was/is for me the Greatest, most wonerfull GURU of all.   
Everything he did.   
Every word he spoke.   
All examples of what we could/are/be.   
A shining light in the darkness of samsara!!

Perhaps one should focus their attention on the meaning of ALL aswell as

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

ALSO   
I notice that when someone went to Ramana with a philosohical question, like"  
why would God will this way? " Ramana ANSWERS THE QUESTION!!!. He doesnt make  
comments about the questioners LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT. Ramana  
does his best to answer the question.   
He doesnt see himself as some superior being looking down on the questioner.   
This is the real thing !!!!100% enlighened being, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   
No trying to get followers.   
No feeling of superiority.

This does not make any sense to me at all. Numbers are a concept of the human  
mind. How could you prove the relavance of numbers and any equations,  
thoughts... _reALity_ even, without consciousness?   
Consciousness is the source of all...everything, infinity including

infinity has no source for it is infinate, it simply _is_.

reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

I notice that when someone went to Ramana with a philosohical question, like"  
why would God will this way? " Ramana ANSWERS THE QUESTION!!!. He doesnt make  
comments about the questioners LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT. Ramana

What Im saying is ALL IS ONE. If ALL = one then if you divide ONE you get  
two, divide again four and so on. So numbers are not at all a product of the  
human mind they are the result of the division of ONE. All of the percieved  
Universe and everything that IS, is as a result of this [apparent] division  
.The human mind itself exists as a result of the divisoin of ONE. All that  
exists is ONE. Existence itself cannot be dual. For this reason all that  
exists is the result of divsion!   
The SELF is SAT CHIT ANANDA. Divide it you get the Duality of subject and  
object. You get the Ego which percieves the Object [not really real though]  
and you get the objects percieved. The percieved qualities of the object the  
,ASTRAL aspect, result from the ANANDA aspect of the SELF.   
The EGO or imaginary "I", results from the Chit aspect of the SELF. When the  
duality ceases in SAMADHI The SELF is revealed as being only ONE.   
Everything fits together, everything is logical, everything makes sense.   
And ALL that exists is CONSCIUOSNESS   
And CONSCIUOSNESS is only ONE!   
And RAMANA was/is for me the Greatest, most wonerfull GURU of all.   
Everything he did.   
Every word he spoke.   
All examples of what we could/are/be.   
A shining light in the darkness of samsara!!

What requirement does is'ness have for the words "ALL" and "ONE" except for  
the processing of thoughts which simply binds oneself from recognising the  
thought's source, that which IS...   
Perhaps one should focus their attention on the meaning of ALL aswell as  
ONENESS. ALL is infinity, this is why i asked earlier, _how can you divide  
infinity?_ All divisions are created by mathmatical concepts of the mind.

calculated and formed within the mind.

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!

So   
If the previous two posts are true.   
Then.   
All that happens,   
All percieved events.   
All [whether real or not] Universes and beings living within the Universes.   
All these exist as a consequence of the Nature of reality.

If you divide ONE you get two, divide again, four and so on. This means that  
numbers [and the nature of all things] are the nature of reality.  
This does not make any sense to me at all. Numbers are a concept of the human  
mind. How could you prove the relavance of numbers and any equations,  
thoughts... _reALity_ even, without consciousness?   
Consciousness is the source of all...everything, infinity including  
perceptions of number and equation, but numbers are not the source of reality,  
infinity has no source for it is infinate, it simply _is_.   
Quote from: mick hutchinson on January 31, 2007, 12:27:53 AM  
If the END and the BEGINING are merely facets[percieved] of the same ONE then  
cause and effect do not exist. I take it that cause and effect are what you  
mean by consequence!!   
PEACE   
M H   
hmmm, yes, i was refering to consequence in the context of cause and effect,  
but i was stating that they are an illusion, which is similer to what you were  
saying. Cause and effect does exist within the illusionary realms of thought,  
but are irrelavant to the self.   
Beggining and end are also illusions of thought. How can you divide infinity?  
(ha haaa yes, i'm aware that you are probably already thinking along these  
lines )   
Nell   
What Im saying is ALL IS ONE. If ALL = one then if you divide ONE you get  
two, divide again four and so on. So numbers are not at all a product of the  
human mind they are the result of the division of ONE. All of the percieved  
Universe and everything that IS, is as a result of this [apparent] division  
.The human mind itself exists as a result of the divisoin of ONE. All that  
exists is ONE. Existence itself cannot be dual. For this reason all that  
exists is the result of divsion!   
The SELF is SAT CHIT ANANDA. Divide it you get the Duality of subject and  
object. You get the Ego which percieves the Object [not really real though]  
and you get the objects percieved. The percieved qualities of the object the  
,ASTRAL aspect, result from the ANANDA aspect of the SELF.   
The EGO or imaginary "I", results from the Chit aspect of the SELF. When the  
duality ceases in SAMADHI The SELF is revealed as being only ONE.   
Everything fits together, everything is logical, everything makes sense.   
And ALL that exists is CONSCIUOSNESS   
And CONSCIUOSNESS is only ONE!   
And RAMANA was/is for me the Greatest, most wonerfull GURU of all.   
Everything he did.   
Every word he spoke.   
All examples of what we could/are/be.

Beloved absrtract   
Ill try to make the post a bit clearer.   
Its horses for courses.   
You can think of it as different planes of existence.   
What is a wise and true statement on one plane is near to pure nonsense  
further down..   
What you are saying is not relevant to the original post.   
If your friends and loved ones die horribly, if youve ever been persecuted.   
If you ever come in contact with nasty violent people. UNLESS YOU are in  
Sahaja Samadhi as was Ramana then you must use your MIND, your logic your  
thought processes to cope with the situation This is the point at which having  
some clear philosophic aproach to life, some way of not being overcome by the  
inevitable emotions that the mind creates for the situation.   
SO.... If the Universe in which we ALL appear to live [but judging from you  
post, you already see as being an illusion within yourself]   
If this Universe seems to make sense rather than being created by a cruel and  
vindictive God, Then its easier to cope with it.   
I am well aware of Ramanas teachings. And can quote from them as well as  
anyone else!   
However, What I see there is, he ALWAYS answered Genuine questions  
intelligently, .His explanations about the nature of things, the Universe the  
reason for things, God etc Rank with or greatly exceed the greatest  
philosophical and Religious thought anywhere else on this planet.   
PAGE 85 to 88 Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge. .There is is  
!!   
The answer to everything.   
God, predestination. free will, the nature of the Self   
AND THE GREAT QUESTION WHY.   
SO maybe you are a liberated being, maybe the terrible suffering see all  
around us does not touch you!   
But that question WHY, WHY, WHY burns a hole in the minds of all those who  
suffer, in the minds of all those whose loved ones suffer.   
So if that question can be answered, if it can be brought into the level of  
the ordinary MIND, then that answer can bring peace and acceptance.   
iTS easy to quote from books, easy to talk phiosophy, words are cheap!   
Peace

ALSO   
I notice that when someone went to Ramana with a philosohical question, like"  
why would God will this way? " Ramana ANSWERS THE QUESTION!!!. He doesnt make  
comments about the questioners LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT. Ramana  
does his best to answer the question.   
He doesnt see himself as some superior being looking down on the questioner.   
This is the real thing !!!!100% enlighened being, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   
No trying to get followers.   
No feeling of superiority.
