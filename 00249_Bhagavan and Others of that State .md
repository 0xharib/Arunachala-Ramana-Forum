## Bhagavan and Others of that State.

I have been in the possesion of a couple of books written about the teachings  
of Bhagavan for a number of years and I have read them several times over that  
period. From them and from the person that gave me his name I knew that he had  
attained the ulimate spiritual quest. But until recently they have had no  
effect on me, but now things have begun to open up. I have found out a little  
more about Bhagavan and some of the people that have been in his presence and  
what an influence he has been for those.   
I was wondering whether anyone knows of a person who has attained the same  
state as Bhagavan and they are of this time. If you do could you let us know  
something about them.   
Regards.   
Paul.

FIRSTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO STATE THAT I FIND THE TITLE BHAGWAN GIVEN TO  
MAHARISHIJI AS OBNOXIOUS AND HE WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY DISCOURAGED SUCH  
SYCOPHANTIC ELEVATION. AS REGARDS AN ENLIGHTENED BEING OF OUR TIMES, THEY ARE  
CHARY OF POSTING ABOUT THEMSELVES. HOWEVER IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT, I WOULD  
SUGGEST YOU SEARCH THE GARHWAL HIMALAYAS

It is appropriate for me to say Bhagavan and for you to say MAHARISHIJI.   
Look at the hue of your message, the one word that is used in it that sums it  
up is OBNOXIOUS.   
Based upon that there can is no credence in searching the THE GARHWAL  
HIMALAYAS.

The title of 'Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi' was given by Ganapathi Muni after  
Bhagavan answered questions that no-one else could answer.   
The word 'Bhagavan' means God, the Supreme - That 'Truth' which clearly  
emanated from Him and stirred the hearts of all who came into His presence or  
read His words. To address Him as anything less is not appropriate.   
It is true that the term 'Bhagavan' has been hijacked by many who aspire to  
fulfill the desires of their egos, but that was clearly not the case with  
Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi.   
The title is therefore accurate in His case and should not be attacked

IMAGINE YOURSELF AS MAHARISHIJI. WOULD YOU HAVE PREFERRED TO BE CALLED  
BHAGWAN. THE PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE FROM A CHRISTIAN MILIUE IS THAT CHRIST  
DECLARES HIMSELF AS THE SON OF GOD. HE BELEIVED THE DAY OF RECKONING WILL BE  
THE DAY HE WILL BE CRUCIFIED. THAT DAY OF JUDGEMENT IS STILL IN THE FUTURE AS  
FAR AS CHRISTIANITY IS CONCERNED. THE REALIZED SEERS OF INDIA MERGED WITH  
BRAHMAN, - THE TRUE REALITY. AS SUCH I FOUND THE TERM BHAGWAN AS OBNOXIOUS.  
THIS IS NO WAY TO INTERPRET MY SUGGESTION FOR YOUR SEARCH IN THE GARHWAL  
HIMALAYAS. YOU CAN SEARCH IN TIMBUCTOO FOR ALL I AM CONCERNED

Naren, those things you say of Christianity do not come from me.   
Ramana Maharshi, Ramakrishna, the Sivapuri Baba, Christ, Buddha are some of  
those who by having books written about their life, have helped with an  
internal quest.   
If one of those has in some way has had a influence and the reaction of it was  
to refer to them internally as Bhagavan, does that make it wrong.   
Thats where it comes from.   
How can I take guidance from one who is misdirected.   
Paul.

## Re:[6]"God, Guru and Self are one and the same"  Bhagavan and Others of that State.

Paul,   
Thats a pretty good question you have asked.   
but as maharshi in his teaching have already mentioned, "as we cook the food  
and we eat only when it is fully cooked, we need to purify our self and when  
you have no thoughts and thoought of "I" is lost, the "SELF" itself guides  
you.   
In this matter, even a GURU wont be able to help you.   
"SELF" itself is the Supreme teacher/guru or whatever word you can use.   
Until there EGO or we have the thought that "i am the doer" one will not be  
able to make progress.   
Cheers

Dear Paul and Naren, why all this fight about addressing Ramana,   
as Bhagavan. He was called so, by Kavyakanta Muni, who recited   
Lalita Sahasranama, and brought rain drops over his head, on a   
hot summer day in Tiruvannmalai. If you can do such a thing, you can call  
Ramana by any name. I am 62 and I do not know any other   
realized soul in the body. Perhaps the closest is Kanchi Sankaracharya,   
Sri Chandrasekhara Saraswathi, who shed in his body about a decade   
and half back, at a ripe of age of 101! No need to go to Garhwal or  
Timbuctoo, if such a realized soul wills, he will appear before you.   
Do not run around. Stay put and read Ramana.

Hiya paul, and everyone else, I'm a newbie, I wonder if you might be  
interested in a site I visit daily: http://www.wayofthebird.com/Commentaries.htm   
It's a "person" by the name of Andrew Vernon, whose spiritual search ended in  
2002, after having taken initiation from Sri Ranjit Maharaj.   
Sri Ranjit's Guru was Sri Siddharameshwar Maharaj, who was also Sri  
Nisargadatta's Guru. So, naturally, his commentaries on the teachings of Sri  
Ranjit Maharaj are intrinsically the same as those of Sri Ramana Maharshi.  
There are 366 commentaries, one for each day of the year, and each month a  
different topic is considered.   
 You can also buy a paperback book of the commentaries quite cheaply on  
Amazon. Andrew Vernon does not put "himself" forward as a Guru, but he does  
invite you to contact him. I've never done so myself, but I've considered it.

Dear Owen, I shall try to find out Andrew Vernon's book. But   
as Bhagavan said: What is the use of reading books endlessly,   
when books are outside the Self, while the Self is within our   
five sheaths. Anyway, I am happy that the question whether to   
call Bhagavan Ramana as \-- " Bhagavan" is temporarily   
ended.
