## Madhura Bhakti - Gopikas

One day Krishna, the naughty thief was suffereing from unbearable headache.  
The queens of Krishna were bewildered and alarmed. They had never heard or  
seen Krishna having such unbearable headache. Mean while sage Narada entered  
the scene. He too was in panic seeing the situation and asked imploringly,  
"Govinda! what sort of drama is this?" The stage director of illusion,  
Madhava suffering from excruciating pain murmured a request, "Narada! this is  
no ordinary headache. This is really terrible. It cannot subside unless the  
dust on the feet of devotees is smeared on My forehead and there is no other  
remedy. Please go and bring immediately." Narada the trotter of all the three  
words obediently tuckled the tamburi, under his arm and started right away. He  
made his first request to the consorts of Krishna. They trembled at this  
request and muttered, " How can we give the dust of our feet too our husband,  
our very life, our Lord! Oh Narada! Have you gone mad to make such a request?"  
Hearing this, Narada ran away and approached some staunch devotees. He  
requested them for the dust on their feet according to Krishna's plea. They  
also shuddered and trembled, "What! The dust of our feet to be smeared on our  
Lord's forehead! Our beloved Madhava! What a sin! It would be the biggest sin  
ever to commit" and to redeem themselves from the sin of hearing such a  
request they slapped their cheeks and disappeared.   
Narada was at bay and unable to think futher. He patted his forehead as if o  
provoke thought, immediately the Gopikas flashed in his mind. He galloped like  
a horse quickly to their village. On seeing Narada, the Gopikas encircled him,  
as everyone knew him. When they were restless and wriggled like a fish out of  
water. "Our Gopala has headache! Our Kannan has headache! he is in pain? Dust  
out of feet is requested!" They dashed into the nearby house and in a trice  
came out with a White cloth. Without any second gathered and knotted it into a  
bundle. Handling over this to Narada they implored him to hurry to Krishna! If  
our Deva Deva, the Lord of Lords is relived of pain, that is sufficient. If we  
have o languish in hell for this sin we are least bothered." Without wavering,  
without any hesitation they fulfilled the wish of their Lord. Is this not real  
devotion? Absolute devotion? This is real Love! This is spotless pure  
devotion? This is real love! This is spotless pure Love! This is selfless,  
childlike Love.   
The Gopikas proved their pure love through such eperiences (not exactly  
proving) it was absolutely involuntary, Spontaneous. For sake of their Lord  
they would readily do anything, jumping in to the flames, jumping in to the  
unfathomable ocean or drink burning hot oil. They proved to the world the  
nature of true love. They would do any such thing without an iota of fear or  
hesitation. They thus became the chieftains of love, exponents of love!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

It is very easy to find the ashram - any rickshaw will happily take you, for  
a ride, for too many rupees, when you first arrive! But from the bus station  
it would cost about thirty rupees and even if they ask more it is very little  
in Western money. The final stop for the Chennai bus will be the bus station  
in Tiru.   
You HAVE to book ashram accomodation in advance - 3-6 months for the winter  
season, as it becomes very busy here. If you have not booked try e-mailing  
right away and then see what happens. If they still have rooms you may be  
lucky.   
Good Luck,   
Regulus

I had little idea that Ramana presence would still be there as described. But  
it would be wonderful to be there even a few days.

Dear 'kde', I typed your name as 'kide' in some other post and   
I am sorry. Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi's Presence is very much   
there in Sri Ramanasramam and you will experience the Power of His   
Presence, when you go over there. Once you make up your mind, the   
visit to Tiruvannamalai will become a reality, sooner or later, regardless   
of distance, expenses, climate or your other preoccupations. The will and   
faith are are essential. Wish you all the best.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R   
Please do not worry about typing my name wrong, I now feel that I must visit  
but for some reason I'm scared I'm not sure why. Thank you for your post.

A Prayer   
When I left Tiru   
I forgot to take my heart   
which blossomed there.   
I know my heart   
is happy now   
next to the Sacred Hill -   
but how   
about me?   
To be apart   
from such a needful thing -   
uneasy task.   
So may I ask   
the gracious Lord,   
to show me a track,   
for this light-minded dog can bring   
again his heartless body back   
towards his heart   
which he forgot.

Dear Vladimir,   
You are always the Heart!   
Where can you leave it?   
Whee can you take it?   
What you did by going to Tiru   
Was the cleansing of the Heart   
With dirt as old as this earth.   
You are now Pure   
Thanks to that washing machine!   
Arunachala Siva.

You have not experienced love but you are trying to describe it.Such things  
hinder your spiritual development.   
When you shed all that is what you are not what remains as residue is love.It  
is thing to be experienced,not to be described.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, Wonderful reply. We are only   
describing all these births, without becoming. We   
are describing the rose, the sugar candy et al.
