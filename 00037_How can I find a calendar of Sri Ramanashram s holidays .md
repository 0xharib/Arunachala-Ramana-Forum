When will be the main celebrities and festivals? I didn't find it on this  
site.   
Thank you.

The Sri Ramanasramam Book Depot has diaries on sale at this time of year that  
list all the holidays for the forthcoming year. Send an email to enquire what  
is available, and specify that you want one with all the festival days listed.
