A while back I posted about the faith I felt upon reading a Ramana quote.  
Upon reading Graham's post "Tolerance" there seemed to be some kind of  
objection about the properness of this topic on a nonduality forum. But  
nothing was posted for discussion. It seemsto me that words and their meanings  
can be a continual source of disagreement of what they mean to one and to  
what they mean to another. It seems to me that is enivtable. but words are all  
we have when in discussion, and that why we are here to be vigilant. So I  
will offer more words on what I meant with the word "faith".   
Today I found this quote from Nisargadatta today that speaks mt intent much  
more eloquently than I did or could. So offer this to the the forum, a quote  
from Nisargadatta: The witness attitude is also faith; it is faith in oneself. You believe that  
you are not what you experience, and you look at everything as from a  
distance. There is no effort in witnessing. You understand that you are the  
witness only, and the understanding acts. You need nothing more, just remember  
that you are the witness only. If in the state of witnessing you ask yourself  
'Who am I?', the answer comes at once, though it is wordless and silent. Cease  
to be the object and become the subject of all that happens; once having  
turned within, you will find yourself beyond the subject. When you have found  
yourself, you will find that you are also beyond the object, that both the  
subject and the object exist in you, but you are neither.

Thanks Nissie, you speak my heart so well.   
With love,

Hi Mark,   
Re: the item on tolerance   
This relates to private mail sent to me querying the validity of the subject  
matter in certain posts.   
The writer did not make the complaint public out of respect, but I thought it  
important enough to make the point about tolerance.
