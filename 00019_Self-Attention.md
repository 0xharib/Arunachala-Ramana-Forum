beneficialthere are parts that can be a little shocking, but what is  
shocked is ignorance anyway....

Dear Matthias,   
Regarding Who am I?, it is a simple 8-page teaching which can be   
easily understood by anyone who has been brought up under Hindu   
traditions. In case, you find that there is any shocking in the text   
that you are referrring from that web.text, please let me know. I   
shall clarify the correct position, as far as I know, to you. I do not   
want to read that full text myself.   
Arunachala Siva.

I have gone through the text.It is not a commentary on "who am i".The only  
shocking thing is that there is nothing in it.There is no clarity   
in conveying what he wants to tell.

Dear Matthias,   
Dr. Raju has answered your point succinctly. As there are bogus   
ascetics, there are bogus Who am I? also. I would like to inform   
Sri Ramanasramam, about it.   
Arunachala Siva.

I dont think that it is neccessary to inform ramanashram...   
it is not a big deal I think   
I know this is very commun way to talk about the truth in th western  
hemisphere...it is neo-advaita and mostly total crap...   
but in fact there are parts that are good..

Dear Matthias,   
I will not inform Sri Ramanasramam. As you might have already   
experienced through your practices, there is no Neo-Advaita.   
Advaita is as old and as beginningless as the Self. There can only   
be neo-Hegelism and Neo-marxism.   
Arunachala Siva.

Hi nonduel,   
The conclusion you have got to is absolutly correct.   
I have gone through this few days back while doing meditation.It was great  
fealing which cant be expressed.   
 **I like to take this oppurunity to ask every member of this forum**,   
1) How much time do you spend for meditation?   
2) When you are writing a comment for a members query, do you have any  
personal experience or do you write this reading books?   
Please be clear....   
Cheers

Noduel,   
The only thing I would disagree with you on, it is not to "prevent" thoughts,  
it is only to quiet the mind in having thoughts so self can be realized.   
ashwin   
1) If time is realized mind is here.   
I spend no time meditating. Vigilance dictates only this moment.   
But self is still waiting for mind to be quiet as of yet. I still go in and  
out of resistance   
2) I read Who am I? Those words pointed the way.   
Have I had a personal experience? Who is this person having an experience?   
Only me.   
Mark

Nonduel,   
Indeed. words get in the way sometimes for me. We speak the same thought.   
Intention can get lost in the words we choose to use. I just wanted to be  
clear cause I tried resisting for many years what I was thinking and feeling  
and it is just more mind games.   
 I find it very difficult to write about nonduality, but it is vigilance for  
me to do so. And I love it.   
That is wonderful you are aware of self when involved in activites.   
As of yet I still fall back into mind when engaged in worldly activites   
 But I am becoming aware of the answear when asking the question "Who am I" or  
especially "who is having this thought"repeatedly.   
Nobody but me.   
I like that   
Mark

Nonduel, your method of practice is correct. When thoughts   
gush forth, you should kill them as you kill the soldiers from the   
fort of the enemy. If all the soldiers are vanquished, the fort   
is in your hands. First, one can keep the eyes closed and be without   
thoughts. Closing the eyes, while doing office or other work, will   
not be possible but by practice, this becomes possible. As Bhagavan   
says towards the end of Who am I?, if 'i' rises, everything 'rises'.   
If 'i' subsides, everything subsides. To the extent, one is humble, it   
is good. When one controls the mind, one can be anywhere, be it   
office or home. In my case, thoughts keep on gushing forth, and   
I try to cling one thought of Arunachala-Siva, like an elephant holding   
on its trunk, an iron chain. This happens from the time I get up till   
I sleep.
