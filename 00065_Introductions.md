I am looking for a teacher of (coming down from) Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi  
in the United States, near Boston if possible. Can anyone help? Thank you.

Hello everyone. My name is Paul Bullough and I have just found this forum.  
What a lovely thing to find. I have been reading Talks with Ramana Maharshi  
for over thirty years, and I still read it on most days. My favourite quotes  
from Maharshi are, 'The world appears as a passing shadow in a flood of light'  
and 'There are no others to mix with'. I try to put his beautiful words into  
practice, and recently have begun to understand more the idea that we are not  
actually doing anything, because 'we' don't really exist. Love to  
everyone...Paul!

Dear Paul,   
 Nice to hear about your practice of reading 'Talks' daily....The analogy ofa  
movie screen with shadows thrown on it for mayic world is very useful Only the  
screen is real;but we sit before the screen, see the shadow, cry or laugh  
...the light required for the projector is the Self which is not affected by  
the drama that goes on, on the screenRamana was fond of this  
analogy...reflection on this is useful way for understanding reality and this  
dreamy world.

Hey Mr. Paul, I read "Talks" a couple of times. See the wonderful   
interpretation of Bhagavan on Kamalalayam (Thiruvaroor), Chidambaram,   
Kasi (Benares) and Tiruvannamalai. To be born in Self, to see Self,   
to die (our mind) in Self and to contemplate Self - is Liberation! Here   
Kamalakayam - Heart; Abhrasadasi - Seat of Consciousness.   
(Talks No. 473)
