How about this concept?   
Your eyes are like cameras.   
Your ears are like microphones.   
Same with all the senses.   
Sensory input devices.   
The information travels along the nerve pathways until it reaches the brain  
where it " Gets cordinated" into a cohesive world view.   
This world view is manufactured by the mind out of the substance of the SELF.   
The mind also creates the "I" which sees the world view, again out of the  
substance of the SELF.   
Therefore what is percieve as the world is not real, its a movie, created by  
the mind!   
Duality is "I" and the world view seen by the "I".   
Both "The audience and the actors are on the screen"   
So what does this say about the realty of the world?   
Is it like a man in a room and his only knowledge of the outer world is by  
television screens on the wall [the senses]   
and if the television screens cease then so does his perception of the world ?  
" There are no sounds for the deaf or sights for the blind"

So really we should not say I am in the world, we should say the world is in  
me!!   
Thats hard to see.   
And hard to be!!!   
How strange is that ?   
Its hard to be what we already are and cant stop being even if we try!!

Have you read The Hard Problem by David Chalmers? It is about the total lack  
of any explanation in modern science of how we are conscious. We can create  
models of how the brain functions on a biochemical level, but there is no  
explanation for why we are aware at all. This is what he calls the hard  
problem, and the same subject is taken up by Roger Penrose, the mathematician  
and physicist, in The Emperor's New Mind. The unavoidable conclusion that  
Chalmers reaches is that consciousness is primary and fundamental, like  
energy. In other words, it does not derive from any other factors. This is  
very relevent to what Ramana taught. In fact, anyone who follows his  
teachings would do well to understand these arguments, as they give a very  
powerful scientific and philosophical underpinning to their practice.   
Personality and ego, on the other hand, are part of the mechanical functioning  
of the brain. They are a result of the conditioning of the brain by the  
environment, and realizing this is a powerful deconditioning tool. You can  
derive Ramana's teachings from entirely scientific sources.   
Realizing that you are not what you thought you were, that what you thought  
you were is merely the unfolding of cause and effect, is extremely liberating.  
You no longer are the slave of your personal history, with the inherent guilt  
and inferiority complexes. There is no longer an excuse for pride in any  
accomplishment, because it is just the action of the human bio-computer.   
Realizing that consciousness is fundamental to the entire universe, and that  
individuality is merely the result of an organizing principle, one sees that  
one is intimately linked to everything and everyone in the universe. You  
realize that you are also the experience of every other creature, though you  
may not be able to see it right now directly. How then can you avoid having  
empathy for all creatures and working toward their realization of their true  
nature?

Quote  
To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the  
mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made  
available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we  
need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and  
exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an  
appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for  
organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an  
appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the  
explanatory work.   
If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness  
would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to  
a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we  
might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy  
problems. Of course, "easy" is a relative term. Getting the details right will  
probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is  
every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience  
will succeed.   
The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we  
think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is  
also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is  
like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we  
see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of  
redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual  
field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the  
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations,  
from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt  
quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What  
unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in  
them. All of them are states of experience.   
It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the  
question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is  
perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and  
auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the  
quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there  
is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an  
emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but  
we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical  
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively  
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.   
If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one. In  
this central sense of "consciousness", an organism is conscious if there is  
something it is like to be that organism, and a mental state is conscious if  
there is something it is like to be in that state. Sometimes terms such as  
"phenomenal consciousness" and "qualia" are also used here, but I find it more  
natural to speak of "conscious experience" or simply "experience". Another  
useful way to avoid confusion (used by e.g. Newell 1990, Chalmers 1996) is to  
reserve the term "consciousness" for the phenomena of experience, using the  
less loaded term "awareness" for the more straightforward phenomena described  
earlier. If such a convention were widely adopted, communication would be much  
easier; as things stand, those who talk about "consciousness" are frequently  
talking past each other.   
The ambiguity of the term "consciousness" is often exploited by both  
philosophers and scientists writing on the subject. It is common to see a  
paper on consciousness begin with an invocation of the mystery of  
consciousness, noting the strange intangibility and ineffability of  
subjectivity, and worrying that so far we have no theory of the phenomenon.  
Here, the topic is clearly the hard problem - the problem of experience. In  
the second half of the paper, the tone becomes more optimistic, and the  
author's own theory of consciousness is outlined. Upon examination, this  
theory turns out to be a theory of one of the more straightforward phenomena -  
of reportability, of introspective access, or whatever. At the close, the  
author declares that consciousness has turned out to be tractable after all,  
but the reader is left feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch. The hard  
problem remains untouched.   
3 Functional explanation   
Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The easy  
problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive  
abilities and functions. To explain a cognitive function, we need only specify  
a mechanism that can perform the function. The methods of cognitive science  
are well-suited for this sort of explanation, and so are well-suited to the  
easy problems of consciousness. By contrast, the hard problem is hard  
precisely because it is not a problem about the performance of functions. The  
problem persists even when the performance of all the relevant functions is  
explained. (Here "function" is not used in the narrow teleological sense of  
something that a system is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any  
causal role in the production of behavior that a system might perform.)

I. sort of. feel that this sort of thing is aproaching it the wrong way round.   
For instance.   
Does anything exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Imagine a void with nothing in it, its still exists.   
Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!   
So since existence IS, AND consciuosness is existence [Ramana said this]   
Then existence must be consciuosness.   
Nothing exists except conscoiusness.   
Therefore experience and experincer are BOTH CONSCIUOSNESS.   
The SELF is aparently split into the "I" which experiences and the object of  
experience.   
The division of Astral [feeling] and mental [information]   
These are made from the nature of the SELF, which is Sat, Chit and Ananda.  
=Existence, awareness and bliss,   
Feelings are the quality which is experienced.   
The awareness is the "I " which experiences the quality.   
The mind makes a filter which says one feeling is nice and another bad. This  
is how come pain can sometimes be pleasurable.   
Its how come Ramana can die of cancer and be totaly unbothered, Pain simply  
didnt hurt him because the mental function that created qualties was dead in  
him. Its how come he had no preferences for food. Food tasted neither good nor  
bad to him!   
He was beyond qualities [which are just the mind.   
 What is absolutely amazing about him is that he could still interact with  
the world!!   
He said that the mind creates the world. This sounds like the raving of a  
madman, UNLESS one looks deeper.   
I believe, our eyes are like cameras, our ears are like microphones, all the  
senses are input devices. The world that we percieve AND all its qualities  
are a PICTURE manufactured out of the SELF, which is consciuosness. The "I"  
which percieves the picture and the picture ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN is what  
RAMANA said.   
So the answer to the "problem" of consciousness is to do as he says, to look  
for the seer. This is what the Vicahare IS.

I am not certain what you mean by a void with nothing in it. Do you mean  
empty space? Because in this universe, there is no such thing. What we refer  
to as empty space is actually teeming with virtual particles which spring into  
existence, annihilate each other, and disappear. Space-time itself is a field  
which is created by mass-energy. In our world, there can be no space without  
energy, just like there can be no magnetic field without electrons. Actually,  
space-time cannot be separated from mass-energy, just as the electron cannot  
be separated from the electromagnetic field. The particle and the field are  
manifestations of the same thing.   
But perhaps you mean something different by void, something which exists  
outside of spacetime as we know it. Perhaps you are referring to the  
experience of vast space that mystics sometimes refer to.   
When you say "Therefore there is no such thing as non exixtence.   
Even if no-thing exixts nothing still exists.   
Existence IS. there can be no oposite to existence.   
Non exiistence is impossibe!!!" are you referring to my statement in my other  
post, when I say: "So in the end, it seems that what we mean by reality is the contents of  
Universal Mind. And to ask if this mind has an independent existence is the  
wrong question. It does not fall into the categories of existence or non-  
existence. Everything exists within it, including time and space."?   
I agree, there is no such thing as non-existence. But there are things which  
we agree do not exist, or no longer exist, like Santa Clause and dinosaurs.  
What I was saying was that consciousness does not fit into either category,  
either as something that exists, or something that does not exist. I believe  
that consciousness is what all that exists, exists within. But it is not  
within the field of time-space. Time-space exists within consciousness. But  
we really are very close to agreement on this subject. I do not believe that  
consciousness and its contents can be separated, any more than a particle can  
be separated from the field it exists within. Whether we identify with the  
contents or with consciousness itself, I think, is tremendously important, and  
I believe it is the central point of Ramana Maharshi's teaching. When we  
identify with the contents, we identify who we are with the physical body, our  
reactions and habits of thought, the things which imprison us. When we  
identify with consciousness itself, then there is the possibility of freedom.   
If you read more of Chalmers, you will find that his viewpoint about the world  
is really similar to your own. He believes that consciousness is PRIMARY.  
But what he is attempting to do is put this into a strict, compelling  
scientific framework, where he can put forward the problems inherent in most  
scientific viewpoints on the subject. For this reason, I find what he is  
doing to be immensely valuable, because it may have a profound influence on  
the worldview of future generations in the west.   
As for the rest of what you say, I'm not sure there is any real difference in  
our viewpoints, just a difference in the way we express them.   
Have to go now, catch you later. It has been interesting.

Perhaps you will find this excerpt of Chalmers more palatable: "I suggest that a theory of consciousness should take experience as  
fundamental. We know that a theory of consciousness requires the addition of  
something fundamental to our ontology, as everything in physical theory is  
compatible with the absence of consciousness. We might add some entirely new  
nonphysical feature, from which experience can be derived, but it is hard to  
see what such a feature would be like. More likely, we will take experience  
itself as a fundamental feature of the world, alongside mass, charge, and  
space-time. If we take experience as fundamental, then we can go about the  
business of constructing a theory of experience.   
Where there is a fundamental property, there are fundamental laws. A  
nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of  
the basic laws of nature. These basic principles will ultimately carry the  
explanatory burden in a theory of consciousness. Just as we explain familiar  
high-level phenomena involving mass in terms of more basic principles  
involving mass and other entities, we might explain familiar phenomena  
involving experience in terms of more basic principles involving experience  
and other entities.   
 Of course, by taking experience as fundamental, there is a sense in which  
this approach does not tell us why there is experience in the first place. But  
this is the same for any fundamental theory. Nothing in physics tells us why  
there is matter in the first place, but we do not count this against theories  
of matter. Certain features of the world need to be taken as fundamental by  
any scientific theory. A theory of matter can still explain all sorts of facts  
about matter, by showing how they are consequences of the basic laws. The same  
goes for a theory of experience.   
If this view is right, then in some ways a theory of consciousness will have  
more in common with a theory in physics than a theory in biology. Biological  
theories involve no principles that are fundamental in this way, so biological  
theory has a certain complexity and messiness to it; but theories in physics,  
insofar as they deal with fundamental principles, aspire to simplicity and  
elegance. The fundamental laws of nature are part of the basic furniture of  
the world, and physical theories are telling us that this basic furniture is  
remarkably simple. If a theory of consciousness also involves fundamental  
principles, then we should expect the same. The principles of simplicity,  
elegance, and even beauty that drive physicists' search for a fundamental  
theory will also apply to a theory of consciousness.   
Wheeler (1990) has suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of  
the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, the laws of physics  
can be cast in terms of information, postulating different states that give  
rise to different effects... If so, then information is a natural candidate to  
also play a role in a fundamental theory of consciousness. We are led to a  
conception of the world on which information is truly fundamental, and on  
which it has two basic aspects, corresponding to the physical and the  
phenomenal features of the world."   
It has been suggested by many physicists that the laws of conservation of  
energy and mass be redefined as, or at least expanded to include, the  
conservation of information. In this light, subatomic particles are viewed as  
"carriers of information". A few months ago, I was even reading a paper by  
Stephen Hawking about how information wasn't really lost forever when  
particles were pulled into a black hole.   
But physics is not the only branch of science where the study of consciousness  
itself has become important. Neurobiologists have been doing studies on the  
effects of meditation on the brain, and finding some very interesting results.  
For instance, the study done by Jim Davidson of the University of Wisconsin  
with Tibetan monks: http://brainwaves.corante.com/archives/2005/07/28/mind_your_brain_the_neuroscience_of_meditation.php

I see that but I think is the wrong way round!   
I think that the existence of matter, and the laws which govern it AND the  
EXPERIENCER which experiences matter and its laws are the RESULT of the  
division of THE PRIMARY ONE WHICH IS ALL!   
If all that exists, no matter how many laws there are, or how many particles  
,galaxies Universes, etc. All that exists is the result of the division or the  
Infinite and Indivisible ONE!!   
This ONE is itself Consciousness!!   
I reckon that it all exists, or appears to exist to as Ramana said " Hold a  
mirror up to the SELF"   
If all that exists is ONE.   
Divide one once, you get two, divide again, four, again eight, and so on.   
 I reckon all the laws pf the Universe are this, the natural result of the  
division of the indivisible ONE which is ALL!!   
The ONE is ALL. The ONE is the ETERNAL timeless SPIRIT. and all that exists is  
that.   
All of time and space and SAMSARA exist [or appear to] to burn up the  
darkness.So that the SELF which is ALL can find itself and PEACE!!   
Samadhi is the ending of experience and experiencer! Experience and  
experiencer are ONE in that state. And it was only ever an illusion that they  
were never ONE in the first place, Experiennce AND experiencer are both  
manufactyred by the mind from Sat Chit Ananda. The incredibly super ecstatic  
flash of I AM of Samadhi is the ending of the ego and the Ultimate reason for  
the existence [apparent] of the Universe and all its laws.   
I think that this debate is the single most important debate that any living  
being can have!But I think tha the answer cant bbe found in cioncepts, but I  
also think that that is no excuse for not involving onesself in it.   
Personally, except for, the one experience of Samadhi, I find meditaion  
difficult, In spite of all the words, I aint no Guru!!!!!   
Peace, Love and Understanding

When I was a teenager, I lived in Florida for a couple of years. This was  
back in the early seventies. I was introduced there to a certain variety of  
mushroom which grew in cow manure locally. This experience radically  
influenced my view of the world, which was suddenly a far more mysterious  
place than I had previously assumed. I became obsessed with trying to  
understand this mystery. There were two avenues of exploration which I found  
very fruitful in this investigation. The first was meditation. The second  
was when I was introduced to relativity theory, and then later quantum  
mechanics. I cannot adequately put into words how important an effect the  
study of theoretical physics had upon my practice. I realized that the  
worldview we were taught in school was entirely false. The world was not this  
place composed of solid, distinct objects, and even time and space were not  
absolutes. I realized that the worldview that was emerging in modern physics  
was just as profound as that described in any of the mystical texts.   
Have to finish this later. Peace.

Anythings that truly pursues the truth must have a meeting point, common  
ground.   
................................................................................   
My theory for the existence of matter is this.   
There is no such thing as nothing.   
Its a total paradox the idea of non existence !!!!   
Ideas of existence and non existence relate to objects, to concepts, ideas  
,thoughts, feelings etc, etc.   
However even if there were no objects, nor anyone to be conscious of obects  
EXISTENCE [reality] itself would still exist.   
A void with no time or space, no objects still has existence. What would exist  
if there was no such thing as existence?   
The question is pure nonsense!   
If reality is existence, and as Ramana says the Self is Sat[existence] Chit  
[consciousness ] and Ananda [bliss] then all that exists is the result of the  
division of Sat Chit Ananda.   
I reckon that the material Universe is the logical outcome of this division!   
If you divide One you get two, divide again four and so on. So mathematics was  
not created its simply the logical outcome of the division ONE! From this its  
not much of a jump to assume that all the laws of the Universe and space and  
time are the result of this division!!!   
I reckon the ONE is fundamentaly neither conscious of itself or happy. I think  
thats as it is ALL, then it contains both aspects of the polarities which make  
up the Universe! Positive Negative, Yin Yang, Matter Antimatter, Conscious  
Unconscious, etc, etc,   
This I believe is an unbearable situation,so it gives rise to the  
manifestation of the physical Universe!!   
Samsara and the Physical Universe is where the darkness is burned up!!!   
Samadhi [Nirvana] COULD NOT EXIST, the unlimited peace and ecstacy of Samadhi  
is PAID FOR by all the things that happen on the material plane.   
All the awful suffering that we have to endure [sometimes] is paying for the  
final escape into Samadhi. This is the LAW OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY!!   
All the energies of the Universe are from the division of the ONE. No energy  
can be destroyed, it just changes form.   
It cant be destroyed because it is an aspect of reality, which is timeless and  
eternal!!   
The Universe is the recyling method of the Self [or God if you like!!] Heaven  
is recyled by the material Universe and its laws, INCLUDING THE LAW OF  
KARMA!!!   
All the energies of the Universe are made from the substance of the Self [ or  
God]   
Nothing exists, except for the SELF [or God].   
Atoms, Galaxies, Black holes, everything, the Ultimate substance is the  
SELF.   
Only consciousnes exists.   
Consciosness is REALITY.   
Therefore the sense percieved Universe is some sort of MIND!!   
This is how come we can forgive evil people, they are part of the burning up  
of the DARKNESS   
Peace   
Mick   
Thats a lot of words a lot of philosophical thinking.   
But its not realisation of the SELF. So its not escape from Samsara.   
Reincarnation scrares me!!   
Not again oh no not again!!!

Also I reckon that all the information about everything is there in the  
Samadhi state, Past present futrure, physics mathematics, time space  
everything,   
There is just no EGO to retrieve the information!!   
mick   
Its like everything is known all at once, simultaneuosly, without thought or  
movement, without or an I that knows.   
Knowiing all and knowing nothing.

A void implies space. Does a void exist if there is nothing to be aware of it?   
Yes, it is all one consciousness.   
What is it then, that reincarnates?   
If it has all been one, from the very beginning, where is the entity that  
reincarnates?   
I'm not trying to espouse some doctrine here, it's a serious question, and I'm  
interested in hearing your viewpoint on the subject.   
I often ask christians a similar question, since most of them believe that the  
personality survives death, and goes to either heaven or hell. Or  
alternately, will arise at the "end of time" when Jesus establishes the  
Kingdom of Heaven on earth and they are judged. I ask them, since we know now  
that so much of our personality is biochemical, will they recognize themselves  
when they are resurrected? Or will they still have the same tendencies? Will  
dumb people still be dumb? What if they were retarded, or semi-retarded?  
But, more importantly, since what we call our personality is the result of  
neuronal connections in the brain, formed by our environment and our responses  
to it, and these responses are due to previous experiences and the neuronal  
connections created by these, and our brains particular biochemistry, which is  
also to a large degree the result of environment, diet, etc., how much of this  
survives? And if this personality does not survive, what is it that is  
judged?   
Of course, in the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, the question is quite  
different. The personality does not survive, only the soul, or Atman, which  
contains the memories of all the previous incarnations of the entity. In  
Advaita philosophy, the Atman is not different than Brahman. Therefore, All  
is Atman. There is only one Self, and this same self animates all sentient  
beings. In this philosophy the universe has a relative existence. In Advaita,  
there are three levels of Truth:  " * The transcendental or the PÄramÄrthika level in which Brahman is the  
only reality and nothing else;   
 * The pragmatic or the VyÄvahÄrika level in which both Jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Ishvara are true; here, the material world is completely true, and,   
 * The apparent or the PrÄthibhÄsika level in which even material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream." -from Wikkipeadia   
Personally, I find this all too complicated, and more of an epistemological  
rather than ontological problem.   
Dvaita philosophy, on the other hand, posits that there is an individual  
atman, and that this is eternally different than Vishnu, whom they consider  
the one, ultimate God. It is so similar to christianity in many respects,  
that I tend to think of it as Hindu Christianity. It even posits eternal  
damnation. In Dvaita, the world is real, and eternally separate from the  
creator.   
About this system, all I can say is, "Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna! Want to buy  
some incense?"

The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it.   
Ive been writing a book on this for 40 years, itl never get published !!   
Il see if I can dig out this bit!!!It might be clearer!!   
There is no such thing as non existence!   
What would there be if there was no existenece?   
Existence IS.   
There is no begining to existence.   
No creation no ending.   
In the physical Universe there is endless cyclic change. The begining and the  
end are eternal!   
I think its like looking at a clock, the hands of the clock represent time  
and space, the clock face represent eternity. The hands move, round and round  
and time seems to pass, but the clockface does not move and is eternal!!!   
If it were possibel to get rid of space and time, existence would still BE!   
Ramana said the self is Sat [existence ]Chit [consciousness ] and Ananda  
[bliss]   
That IS existance!!   
There is no such thing as noconsciuosness. Everything is consciuosness!!   
Its just not SELF CONSCIUOSS not Self realised!!   
I read a bit on ZEN which said even grass can become enlightened. [vegetable  
matter that is!]!   
Everything has the potential for Self Awarereness because its IS awareness.   
The separating of I and object is an illusion! Albeit a hard one to shake!!   
So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter.   
Trying to take these ideas higher cannot work,You cant split an atom with  
nutcrackers!! You have to have the right tools for the job!   
Ramana says to look for the ego, and that if we do, it turns out that it  
doesnt exist!!   
The strangest thing he ever said, in my opinion was.......   
"As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego isnt real  
,nothing ever happens!!!"   
He also said that becoming enlightened was "like waking up from a dream of  
wandering all over the world!!   
There are elements of the minds functions which lead it to go round and round  
in circles when it tries to probe into such matters.   
Some stuff just cannot be solved with the thinking process!   
The Ultiimate Truth is this, it can be known, but not with the mind. Ramana  
used Silence!!   
Peace, love and understanding

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

"In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines  
its light on all of the DVD simultaneuously!!

Time lapse photography shows a completely different picture of, for instance

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines  
its light on all of the DVD simultaneuously!!

Time lapse photography shows a completely different picture of, for instance

If we only slightly change the rate at which we percieve events , what we

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!

The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the

The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

"In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines  
its light on all of the DVD simultaneuously!!

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!

The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the

The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly

percieve drastically alters. This is to bolster the CAKE metaphor.

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

"In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Dear mick, You have yourself said that LSD and other such   
drugs will not give realization. Sadhu Om's experience and your   
experience cannot be questioned but you will agree that perhaps   
the drugs make your "way" look somewhat easier, but still the   
goal is not assured. It is like going round the Arunachala Hill,   
by car, instead of by foot. The Goal can be attained only when   
Goal wants you to attain it. Is it not? As T.S. Eliot put it: "There is a  
time, there is a time, when everything looks alike... After such   
knowledge, what forgiveness?" Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian.R   
I agree with you. However when we go somewhere it is helpful to have  
signposts to show us the way. Without those LSD experiences I would not have  
known that Samadhi was possible. Or that some of my troubles were Kundalini  
related.   
It isn't a quetion of making it easier, it's a question of belief. There is  
the Yoga idea of 3 types of knowledge The first type is, ,,, There is a flame  
there, you stick your finger in it. aaaargh !! it hurts, you know this, no  
one told you. The second type of knowledge is, ,,, Someone says to you, " If  
you sitck your finger in that flame it will hurt you " and you BELIEVE them  
.This is only belief, whether the belief is true or not it's still onle belief  
. The third type of knowledge comes from within.   
Belief causes all sorts of trouble, look at all the fake Gurus and religious  
leaders. Con men tricking people, read a few books and pretend to be a  
realised being. People believe all sorts of crazy things.   
So, maybe some personal experience however breif is worth more than reading  
books and believing people. Beings such as Ramana Maharishi are not exactly on  
every street corner !!!   
Ramana is/was 100% genuine, the real deal. But as he said Western people find  
it harder because they are more outward looking. So being given a doorway to  
your own interior can be very helpful [ to some people ]

Dear mick, I can never question your belief. Bhagavan Ramana   
is a different person, when He was in body. He never wore sandals   
in His life. He never wore ochre robes. All His readings and writings   
were after He realized. It is like someone suddenly appearing on the   
top of a hill and then descending to the foothill to tell others His   
experience atop the hill. We are all on the foothills, trying various   
ways, various books, various Gurus, transcedental meditation and   
other types, shifting from one way to another and so on. Eventually,   
if the goal is achieved, the ways are forgotten. Is it not?   
Arunachala Siva.

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!

The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly

So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the

The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

"In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

Or a DVD metaphor   
The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines  
its light on all of the DVD simultaneuously!!

Time lapse photography shows a completely different picture of, for instance

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

"In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!

The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the  
passage of time.   
The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly  
represents the Samadhi state, the SELF or God!   
So Samadhi would be when the laser stops its sequential movement and shines

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!"   
If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!

Mick,   
Why do you keep repeating that there is no such thing as non-existence? I  
thought we agreed on that a long time ago.   
You say that if you got rid of space and time, existence would still be. What  
sort of existence? If there is no experience is there existence? I can not  
imagine experience without some sort of time and space, though it may be  
undefined, containing nothing changing, just an eternal sea of consciousness.   
I say may because, although I have had several what I consider profound  
experiences, I have certainly not had that one, so for me, it is metaphysical  
speculation. I consider it very important for the process to be aware of the  
difference between what one knows and what one merely thinks or believes, and  
to question everything.   
"So philosophical ideas of an "I" which is aware of " the Universe" are only  
usefull for the investigation of the structure of matter." Regardless of any  
philosophical ideas about it, this I which is aware of the universe is the  
only way that we investigate anything. Everything you have written is  
philosophical ideas about the I which is aware of the universe, so I don't  
know why you would make such a statement.   
I think the crux of what you are trying to get at is the subject-object  
dichotomy, and you are trying to say that this dichotomy isn't real, that it  
is a mental construct.   
This is why I stated that everything exists within consciousness. (Or, at  
least, everything we know of exists within consciousness, and from what we  
know of how the universe functions, as information about interrelationship, it  
seems to be a fairly safe assumption.)   
"The trouble is some stuff just doesnt get into words properly.   
They can actually mean both opposite sides of the meaning! The higher you try  
to go the less adequate they are !   
You can have a flash of insight and really struggle to find words for it."   
Yes, language is limited by our common, past experience. Therefore it is  
inadequate for describing something qualitatively different. And as  
Krishnamurti always pointed out, the concept is not the thing. Concepts are  
what interfere with direct experience of reality. Also our somatic habits  
interfere, but there is a close interrelationship there. Therefore, I  
consider it important that meditation is an ongoing process of observation,  
observing our reactions to everything we do, not just something that we do  
when we sit.   
Talk to you later. It's past my bedtime. Ciao.

Ramana said the mind is just thoughts, he said stop thinking and show me where  
is the mind?   
I reckon that the personality is just mental activity.   
If the percieved world is a picture within the Self. as Ramana says it is  
,then we dont really incarnate. the pictures come within us when there is an  
incarnation and there are no pictures when there is no incarnation. So really  
the Self is always itself, it doesnt incarnate at all. Only the pictures come  
and go. This is roughly what Ramana says about it.   
This" Is there somthing that is definately you and something which is  
definately me? " is the strangest question !!   
Maybe the raindrop and the ocean metaphor explains it, when the raindrop falls  
into the ocean it stll exists but is one with the ocean!   
I dont know much about physics, but I do know that the Newtoinian view of  
space and time breaks down at Quantun level [is that the right way of putting  
it ? ]   
So maybe the normal way of viewing ourselves is the same, maybe we cant  
discuss "You" and "I" when we reach the Universal level.   
Maybe the very language which we use is so tied to cognition of objects and  
the Subject Object relationship, that it flounders when it tries to go  
deeper.   
Have you got " Be as you are The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi" by David  
Godman. It has sections at the where Ramana answers quetions on just about  
everything!!   
It seems to me that repeated readings of the words he said, sort of, answer  
questions.   
Mouni Sadhu, one of Ramanas last pupils, said that the meaning is not the  
words, and that ideas can be expressed in many different sets of words.   
 He also wrote about Akashic Cliches, which are Astro Mental entities which  
contain information, If a person contacts an Akashic Cliche then that person  
has access to the information in the Cliche.   
So reading Ramanas teaching over and over opens the mind to the Akashic  
Cliches that surround Ramana.   
 From this seems to come a wordless undrestanding of the things of which he  
speaks. An insight which is deeper than the words alone could convey   
Great talking to ya Dedhed   
Miick.

Ramanas bit about deep sleep probably answers the question "Is there existence  
if there is no experience"   
In deep sleep there are no dreams and no awareness of an individual "I" which  
experiences, yet there is exixstence!   
 That one "experience " of Samadhi I had left me sort of half way up and half way down and not knowing the way back [or I did and I forgot!!!] Anyway, it cant truly be called an "experience" because the "Me" which experiences disolves. There is just consciuosness. without an object to be consciuos of or a "Me" which is consciuois of it.   
Sorry if I keep saying there is no such thing as nothing, but for me its like  
a basic premise which has to be stated because so much is based on it, sorry!   
It relates to the thing which you are saying about information not being lost  
too.   
That "ONE" is all information, sort of,by implication.   
It took me about 20 miles on my bicycle to get this one together!!!!!   
Again its based on something Ramana said!!   
When we speak we say "I" did this " I " did that "I " went here or there etc  
,etc. In this statement there is an implicit assmptiion, the assumption of  
existence, the assumption that "I" exist. Neither of us could communicate if  
we didnt exist. !!!!!!!!   
Therefore just in the knowledge that "I can communicate is information of  
existence.   
 So in the Samadhi state, which is knowledge of the true "I" l,the knowledge  
of all information exists, just by impication. In the form of this statement.  
If A is true then B must also be true because A cannot exist if there is no B.  
Therefore Samadhi has all information of all in it, without having any  
information in it at all.   
I hope Im not waffling on to much for you!!

Regardless of whether there is any personal identification, there is still an  
experience, there is still some quality that one is aware of, or there is no  
awareness.   
I think personality may be defined as habits of mental activity. These habits  
are reinforced by our beliefs about who we are.   
Yes, Newtonian physics breaks down at the quantum level, and also at very  
large scale, and at speeds approaching the speed of light.   
You might find this interesting. As an object approaches the speed of light,  
time slows down, and space contracts in the direction of movement. For a  
particle traveling at the speed of light, time and space as we know it  
disappear. We say it takes light about nine minutes to reach from the sun to  
the earth. But for the light, it is instantaneous.   
One may say the universe is consciousness, or that the universe is an object  
of consciousness, and in practical terms, it makes little difference. But  
since the universe appears to have had a beginning, and consciousness cannot  
have, I tend to believe the second is true. Then again, in a sense there is no  
contradiction between these viewpoints.

In a way you seem to be saying that there is nothing except experience.   
Ramana, and Jana Yoga says that experience and experiencer are both illusions!   
Both exist as pictures in the Self.   
When we speak of expreience we are really speaking of the Astral Quality, the  
feeling and the Knower of the experience.   
The feeling is made from the Ananda aspect of the Self, and the experiencer  
,The "I" thought, the Knower is made from the consciouseness aspect of the  
Self. But really these two aspects are indivisible and they only appear to be  
divided due to the action of the mind.   
It may be that it is quite literally true that as Ramana says, " If the "I "  
thought stops, then the Universe ceases to exist ", not just as a subjective  
experience, but it really does not exist anymore!!   
Like this::: If you have a circular CAKE, the cake is one single cake, if you SLICE the  
cake what you percieve depends ON WHERE YOU CUT THE CAKE!! You can have big  
thick slices, or thin slices, or medium slices, but no slice can ever be the  
whole!!   
If we apply this slice idea to our preception of existence we might see that  
what we percieve as atoms, molecules, galaxies, quarks, quasars etc,etc all  
these ARE JUST WHERE OUR PARTICLAR BRAIN MIND COMBINATION CUTS THE SLICE!!  
.This idea incorporates physics and also transcends it.   
Now !   
 What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS.   
So the Big Bang is no more the begining of the Universe than the first station  
on a railway line is the creation of the railway,   
This could mean that time literally stops in Samadhi, and in that state one  
is at the begining, the end, the middle all at once!   
Ramana said that space and time are within you! So maybe this isnt a metaphor  
,its the literal truth. If the individual Ego disolves into SAMADHI it is  
quite literally at the begining the end and the middle all at once!! [A  
religius person might bsayn that God is everywhere all at once]   
This would explain Ramanas statement. "As the things that happen, only happen  
to the Ego and the Ego is not real, nothing ever happens."   
So this isnt metaphorical at all, its the literal TRUTH!!!   
 If all of time and space, the begining and end are fixed, then to a being  
that is at the begining the end and the middle all at once, there is no  
movement.   
 It is only to those like us whos awarness is caught in the Ego, and its  
association with the body and events in time, that things apear to happen!!   
Peace

The laser which reads the information sequntially represents the EGO and the

The Whole of the DVD, where all the information exists simultaneuosly

I just had an idea about the speed of light.   
Its independant of the speed of the obserever, right?   
So in the train simile, a bullet fired from a train has its velocity added to  
the velocity of the train. Whereas a light beam doesnt.   
What if its because the light isnt moving?   
What if its just us thats moving, like a train going at a fixed speed on a  
raillway line. The line is moving relative to the train at the speed at which  
the train is moving or, relatively speaking, but really it is the train which  
moves not the line.   
This might explain why the speed of light is independent of the observer.   
If events are predestined like the pictures on a cine film, then the speed of  
light is the frame rate.   
If events are fixed and unchangeable then time flows through them.   
The light is fixed, it doesnt move, we move through time and so the light  
apears to move.   
Video tape metaphor. If you wind back the tape a specific event is always at a  
particular place on the tape.   
So the whole of space time, its begining and end exist in the greater  
dimension of the Superconsciuoisness.   
The Ego, tied as it is to the Physical body experiences space time as a series  
of consecutive exents, with connected chains of cause and effect.   
The way our sensory and mental mechnisms work cause the"cake" to be slliced in  
such a way that we percieve time and space relative to the continuation and  
survival of the physical organism. Therfore we see things in terms of  
beginings and endings and so we look for the begining and ending of the  
Universe.   
Ramana said that Creation theorys are just there to keep happy people who seek  
to know the genesis of things. Which can seem quite negative, almost as  
though he disaproved of science and religion, but if something like Im saying  
is true, then it makes sense!

If the universe has ceased to exist any time recently, no one seems to have  
noticed.   
Again we seem to be dealing with what is largely a semantic issue. I don't  
know anything about astral qualities, since I long ago gave up such  
metaphysical speculation. But in whatever terms that you want to put it,  
consciousnesses implies something that it is conscious of. This does not need  
to be dualistic. There can be experience without a separate experiencer, who  
filters that experience and alters it. If you really dislike the term, I can  
use alternate ones, but it seems a servicable enough one to me.   
The real problem is the center created by the ego, which creates an "in here"  
and an "out there". When we are busy desiring something out there, or fearing  
it, or trying to impress someone "out there", we are creating psychological  
boundaries and a false center, which we try to protect at all costs. As the  
Buddha pointed out, this is the root of human stress.   
The ego looks at everything by asking "how can I use this?" or "is this a  
threat to me?", and therefore never sees the world as it is.   
 When I was twenty, I was explaining to a friend how the relationship between  
the lines in a hexagram in the I Ching determined the meaning of the hexagram.  
I forget which one. I was into studying that stuff at the time. All of a  
sudden, it was like the whole world changed. I don't know how well I can  
explain it. Tensions I had never realized existed in my chest and abdomen  
suddenly melted, and it seemed that the world wasn't quite solid anymore. It  
was like this world was superimposed over a vast field of consciousness, and  
there were these waves of flux between the universe and this new openness in  
my chest. And I could feel pure open consciousness in the people around me.  
In fact, it took me a while to realize that the people around me weren't  
experiencing the same thing I was. It was like the whole world had changed in  
an instant. The boundary had collapsed spontaneously and caught me completely  
off guard. I think that is the way it usually happens, because if you are  
looking for it, it can't happen. "You looking for it" is something extra.  
The experience came and went, with varying intensity, for a couple months, but  
gradually faded away. I have felt it occasionally, rarely, since then, but  
never again with the original strength or persistence. I usually will not  
speak about this, but I wanted you to realize that this was not merely  
conceptualization on my part. I think this may be what some writers have  
referred to as the experience of 'grace'. I don't think I understood what true  
humility was until that moment. And it was nothing that I realized, it was  
being shown to me. Suddenly I was on very intimate terms with a much larger  
consciousness. It was not like I was suddenly enlightened, but like the world  
was. There was no attainment. The very idea of personal attainment seemed  
obscene blasphemy at the time.   
Back then, my primary influences were Krishnamurti, Sri Aurobindo, Arica, and  
Buddhism. Soon afterwards, I was drawn to the Sufi mystics, especially Rumi,  
then later to the writings of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists, and to the later  
works of Thomas Merton. As different as these sources seem on the surface,  
the underlying experiences seem very similar.

Thats a wonderful experience.   
Im worried, you seem like a very nice chap and I dont want to seem like a know  
it all, but that is just the foothills of Samadhi itself.   
Its just a tiny glimpse. The fact that the "I "that percieves still existed  
in you shows this.   
Im not trying to be competitive or thinking that Im better than anyone, Ive  
been there and done that and it caused me a fair bit of suffering, vanity is  
painful!!!   
Samadhi or Niravana is like becoming the entire Universe absolute release  
ectstacy beyond ones widest dreams. In fact ecstacy doesnt even begin to  
describe it. As I came out of it I saw the entire Universe within me,the  
interelationship of all things [,which is what astrology really is ],then I  
saw the storehouse of previous lives, sometimes I wish Id stopped and looked  
in there.   
 Next the thinking process restarted. Maybe I should have tried to remain  
still but I didnt.   
Still some of this extrodinary consciousness persisted.   
Somone I knew came in to visit, he sat in front of and I looked into his eyes.  
I could see right into him, see things about him that he did not know himself,  
And as he spoke I could say the words that he was saying with him I could  
speak with him simultaneously. He was flabbergasted and so was I. I could  
tell him about his past experiences just by looking into his eyes. I could  
read the thoughts of those around me easily, knowing what they were going to  
say before they spoke.   
I closed my eyes and I could still see the room and the people in it with my  
eyes closed.   
When I slept that night I did not loose consciuosness, sleep was like being  
encased in crystal.   
Next day I gave in to a desire and it all disapeared !!   
This experience was preceded by an arousal of the Kundalini.   
The thought came to me surrender to me, so I did and the Kundalini rose, each  
chakra opening one by one. The crown chakra was like peacocks feathers or a  
fountain on in/on the crown of my head. All this was incredebly ectatic. Then  
came Samadhi, which I dont really recall. I know it was absolute release  
ecstacy beyond anything imaginable.   
All this happened on Strawberry fields LSD in 1971.   
In the 500 or do trips that I took after that it was never repeated. I had  
some very interesting experiences but never that again.   
Ive had a very very wierd life, most people wouldnt believe most of it.   
Ive behaved like a complete idiot lots and lots of times.   
The Rock n Roll lifestyle!   
Ive come here hoping maybe I might meet an enlightened being.   
I know its all true, what RAMANA says.   
I just keep getting side tracked, Im 60 an I see death coming, I remmember  
enough of my last life not to want to return.   
Memories of it in my childhood made my parents think I was mad. They took me  
to a psychiatrist. I was about 8.   
I didnt remmember "I was " I rememebered I AM, I am not this little boy. yet I  
still cannot remmember that monks name, I remmember the sword going through my  
heart. And the thought "not now I cant die now."   
 I thought that God would protect me if I spoke the truth.   
It was as it says in the Tibetan book of the Dead. I saw the world around me I  
went up above the Monastry and could plainly see the hill it stood on and the  
green fields around it. Then everything went green, some gold. Then nothing.  
But I think some of my childhood nightmares might have been abou the  
interincarnation life!   
I see all the suffering in the world and I know that the next life could see  
me born with a disease, or in a war zone.   
I dont want to fight the endless wars of Samsara. Kill for God, fight for the  
glorious cause. Fall in love, your loved ones die, someone kills you AGAIN !  
You get a horrible disease. They rape your loved ones and kill your children.   
So I hope that I miight meet an enlightened being here, and Im scared that  
enlightened beings can see what a fool you are !!   
All these theories about the Universe dont stop suffering!   
I dont meditate enough and I dont do it well enough.   
Peace and love   
Mick

No, theories about the universe don't necessarily end suffering, but man will  
always struggle to understand the universe and his place in it, till he  
finally does. And this is as it should be. When I was reading your  
description, I thought, this sounds like someone doing psychedelics. Sure  
enough, it turned out it was. As someone who did quite a lot of them, I would  
be the last person to denigrate what occurs when you ingest them. You  
certainly can experience bliss and telepathic states. But they are very  
tricky. They create a sense of awe, and sometimes things that seem very  
profound on them, later turn out to be just plain wrong. I do not consider  
them to be any sort of substitute for meditation. In fact, one thing I  
learned from the Sufis, the experience of States is not that important. The  
deconditioning of the self is what is of utmost importance, and States can  
actually be a hindrance to the work, if one places too much importance upon  
them. So what is actually important is the work on oneself, which includes  
meditation, but meditation should not be just something we do when we sit. It  
must become an integral part of life. Meditation should never be looked upon  
as something difficult, or thought of as something one does poorly or well.  
Practice should always be easy and never strained. And it is important to  
guard against gaining ideas in one's practice. But one should always continue  
in one's practice. In soto zen, they would teach you, just to sit and do  
meditation, that is enlightenment. If you sit and observe the breath, or  
awareness of the body, or whatever, that is the goal, there is nothing else to  
accomplish. When we think meditation is difficult, or we are unable to do it,  
that means we have some gaining idea, some expectation that we need to let go  
of. If thoughts come, that is OK, that is actually an important part of the  
practice. We learn a great deal about ourselves from the thoughts that come.  
If we get lost in thoughts, that's OK, too. You just go back to your practice  
when you become aware. If you practice in this way, and abide in awareness of  
the presence of the self, you will make progress.

You do not have to worry about an enlightened being seeing you for what you  
are. If they are really enlightened, they will look upon you with total  
compassion, because they realize they are the world. Where exactly are you?   
BTW, have you read Meeting Life, by Krishnamurti? Definitely the best  
collection of his work. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

The word "Astral " reffers to the qualitative nature of all experience.   
So in the statement thats a nice hat, Hat reffers to the obect percieved and  
"Nice" reffers to the quality [an illusion created by the mind!]   
A "nice " thought has pleasant feelings associated with it and a "bad "  
thought has unpleasant feelings associated with it.   
The mind percieves and object or event in the world [which is a picture within  
us ] and adds a quality to it good or bad.[both are ultimately illusions]   
The Astro Mental plane is the normal waking consciuosness.   
The books of Mouni Sadhu are a good source of this type of information.   
Ramana was said to be beyond qualities, because qualities are created by the  
mind and Ramana had transcended the mind altogether!   
Peace

" What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS."   
What Einstein meant by relativity theory was that time and space are not  
absolutes, but ARE relative to the viewpoint of the observer. And, yes, you  
could say that light doesn't travel at all. From it's own perspective, there  
is no distance traveled, and no time passed. In a very real sense, you could  
say that it is defining distance and time. There are aspects of this that are  
unbelievably bizarre, but it would take up too much space to go into them  
here.   
One weird thing, though, is how light travels. You mentioned the key fact.  
Regardless of the movement of an object, light still moves away from it at the  
same speed. Because there is no such thing as absolute space, no absolute  
framework of space and time. We can only say objects are moving or at rest  
compared to a particular frame of reference. For instance, say an asteroid and  
the earth are on a collision course. From our frame of reference, we are at  
rest, and the asteroid is moving towards us. From the asteroids, it is at rest  
and we are moving towards it. Light does not discriminate. It merely describes  
the distance between the two objects by the time it takes to travel between  
the two, and describes the rate at which this distance is decreasing by  
shifting towards the blue end of the spectrum. Light from both objects will  
appear to have the same blue shift when observed from the other. If objects  
are moving away from each other, light shifts toward the red end of the  
spectrum.

BTW, Physicists are working very hard on a general theory to supplant  
relativity and quantum mechanics, each of which only describe things under  
different circumstances, but contradict each other in their separate spheres.  
So a Theory of Everything is needed, (TOE for short) which can describe  
everything, without having to refer to one theory under certain circumstances,  
and the other to describe events under different ones. The two major  
candidates are loop quantum gravity and string theory, but both are still very  
incomplete, and extremely complicated. And the observation that the expansion  
of the universe is speeding up instead of slowing down has further complicated  
matters. Personally, I think the final theory will incorporate parts of all  
these theories, plus consciousness. When we finally find it, I think it will  
be responsible for a quantum leap in the evolution of the consciousness of  
mankind. Which is why I consider it so important.

" What if all of time exists, simultaneously, With the begining and the end  
always there,   
What if the moment NOW passes through time etenally? In this scenario time  
does not move or change and we merely pass through fixed events!   
This explains predestination!   
It also might explain the speed of light, but Im a bit out of my depth here.   
It might be that the speed of light is not the speed at which light travels  
,because it doesnt travel at all! Its fixed, its always there.   
Maybe the speed of light is a measure of the rate at which consciuosness  
passes through time!!   
If events are fixed and the passage of time is like a train traveling on a  
railway line, then the speed of light is the speed of the train! And this is  
where the space time peculiarities come from.   
What if all of time and space exist eternally, the begining of the Universe  
,and the end eternally exist simultaneuosly in the SELF or GOD, or the  
SUPERCONSCIUOSNESS."   
What Einstein meant by relativity theory was that time and space are not  
absolutes, but ARE relative to the viewpoint of the observer. And, yes, you  
could say that light doesn't travel at all. From it's own perspective, there  
is no distance traveled, and no time passed. In a very real sense, you could  
say that it is defining distance and time. There are aspects of this that are  
unbelievably bizarre, but it would take up too much space to go into them  
here.   
One weird thing, though, is how light travels. You mentioned the key fact.  
Regardless of the movement of an object, light still moves away from it at the  
same speed. Because there is no such thing as absolute space, no absolute  
framework of space and time. We can only say objects are moving or at rest  
compared to a particular frame of reference. For instance, say an asteroid and  
the earth are on a collision course. From our frame of reference, we are at  
rest, and the asteroid is moving towards us. From the asteroids, it is at rest  
and we are moving towards it. Light does not discriminate. It merely describes  
the distance between the two objects by the time it takes to travel between  
the two, and describes the rate at which this distance is decreasing by  
shifting towards the blue end of the spectrum. Light from both objects will  
appear to have the same blue shift when observed from the other. If objects  
are moving away from each other, light shifts toward the red end of the  
spectrum.

BTW, Physicists are working very hard on a general theory to supplant  
relativity and quantum mechanics, each of which only describe things under  
different circumstances, but contradict each other in their separate spheres.  
So a Theory of Everything is needed, (TOE for short) which can describe  
everything, without having to refer to one theory under certain circumstances,  
and the other to describe events under different ones. The two major  
candidates are loop quantum gravity and string theory, but both are still very  
incomplete, and extremely complicated. And the observation that the expansion  
of the universe is speeding up instead of slowing down has further complicated  
matters. Personally, I think the final theory will incorporate parts of all  
these theories, plus consciousness. When we finally find it, I think it will  
be responsible for a quantum leap in the evolution of the consciousness of  
mankind. Which is why I consider it so important.

Also I think that Astro Mental refers to that plane of existence where  
,Leprechauns, Fairies, or whatever they are exist. Some sort of disembodied  
minds. When aked if they exist, Ramana said they do. When asked where they are  
he replied " In you".   
Some people have had some experience of this area of the mind under the  
infuence of psychedelic drugs.   
 And very strange it is too!   
Definately not to be played with is the occult!!   
Has an astral quality which reminds one of the smell of sulphur!

Yes, I'm familiar with him, The point I was making was that talk about astral  
planes and so forth are a bunch of Theosophical doctrine that I find  
questionable, and have no need of. Mouni Sadhu, man I haven't heard that name  
in 25 years! I read his "In Days of Great Peace" when I was in high school.  
I think it was my introduction to Ramana and Sri Aurobindo. I was trying to  
remember his name a few months ago, and just couldn't do it. Thanks.   
Speaking of people with ties to Theosophy, what are your thoughts on  
Krishnamurti? I realize he hasn't been dead 50 years, but he never claimed to  
be a guru, so I suppose discussing him is alright.   
Also, have you read The Sufis by Idries Shah?
