## Maha Vibhuti Sahitam and Isvaratvam - 2

The Brahma Jnanis always dwell steeped in the bliss of Brahman   
and they do not want to exhibit siddhic powers. The Siddhic   
powers will go against the nature of destiny, which Hindu philosphy agrees  
that these should be borne with perseverence   
to wipe out our sins and misdeeds of the past. Secondly, Brahmanhood does not  
mean interfering with Brahman's work.   
Very rarely, Jnanis have exhibited some siddhic powers, in most   
deserving cases. This is more an exception than a general rule.   
Jesus Christ cured only a couple of leprosy affected persons,   
and again one or two demon-afflicted persons and lame and   
paralytic. He raised only one Lazrus from death. Bhagavan   
Ramana thus raised from death only one young boy, when he   
was bitten by a snake and was dying black and blue. He   
never interfered with destiny of two young babies of Mahalakhsmi Amma, because  
they were to be liberated. Why save them   
and make them toil in this world? In one case, he fed the child   
with a spoon of milk, and that too Mahalakshmi Amma wanted   
Him to do. He was hesitant. But He did it. In the second case, He applied  
Vibhuti on the forehead of the baby, reluctantly,   
due to adamance of Mahalakhshmi Amma. This second baby   
also got liberated and left the world.   
Bhagavan Ramana has once told: "If I start reviving the dead   
to life, then tomorrow this Asramam will be full of corpses,   
for my assistance!" Bhagavan Ramana never wanted to cross   
swords with destiny. Even in His own case, He did not do!   
Aiswaryamavyahatam - Such a devotee will get all riches   
and powers. But he would not care a penny for it.   
Sarvatmatvamithi sputkrutamidam yasmadha mushmim stave,   
Tenasya sravanath tadhartamananath dhyanacha sangirtanath,   
Sarvatamatva maha vibhuti sahitam syadhichvaratvam svatha,   
Siddhyeth tatpunarashtadha parniathanch aisvaryamm avyahatam.   
 \- Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram - Verse 10   
There are a few verses added much later (not Sri Sankara's) on   
this poem. We shall quickly find the meanings.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Maha Vibhuti Sahitam

Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram, Verse 10, is a Palasruti, the Benediction Verse.   
The all-pervasiveness of the Atma is clearly expounded in this   
hymn. By its recital, hearing, and meditation on its implied   
meaning, the devoted disciple attains to that all-pervasiveness   
of the Atman. He further fully realizes his oneness with It,   
including the unhindered lordship over the whole universe, becoming the very  
essence of the eight fold manifestations referred   
to in Verse 9. He reaches the plenitude of realization and spiritual   
joy.   
This Verse speaks about all-pervasiveness of the Atman, which is   
attained by the devotee or a sadhak. Sarvatmavtam says Sri   
Sankara. What does it mean? Does it mean, that you will   
become God or Brahman. Yes. You will become Brahman or   
God but you will not become the ruler. Here the rulership is   
not indicated because, after realizing Brahman, where is separate   
"you" to become a ruler and have many people to be ruled?   
The ruler and the ruled implies dualism and it is not definitely   
indicated here. We become one with Brahman and whatever   
Brahman is, we are. That is all.   
Then, Sri Sankara says Isvaratvam and mahavibhuti sahitam.   
WE become Isvara with all powers and riches. Here again   
it is indicated here, that the mahavibhuti sahitam isvaratvam,   
is the power of siddhis and supernatural powers. But a Brahma   
Jnani will not care for them. Bhagavan Ramana says that siddhis   
are again dreams. Why do you want dreams, when you are   
constantly awake in Brahmanhood? So these powers and riches   
would come if one wants, but one will not want.   
Why great Jnanis do not exhibit supernatural powers?   
We shall see.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram - the last few verses  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 14, 2009, 10:20:44 AM  
---  
The last few verses of Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram were added   
later by some other saints and poets and these were not Sankara's.   
However, for day to day chanting, these are also included. Here   
is where, Sri Dakshinamurty is picutrised as sitting at the banyan   
tree, and all munis and rishis are sitting before him. The original   
verses do not give any such details. Sri Sankara says the guru   
is dakshina-amurty, the formelss Self. He is the Isvara of three   
worlds, he is Dakshinamurty Deva, he vanquishes births and deaths, and all the  
miseries associated with life and death.   
He is the seat of Jnanam. Jnanadhatharam. (Verse 11)   
The Verse 12 describes the wonder, Chitram: At the northern end (spiritual north pole), at a banyan tree,   
there is a wondrous thing happening. The disciples (Sanaka   
and others) are old but the Guru is young. This Guru is in   
Silence and explains the Truth and the disciples get their   
doubts solved. (Verse 12)   
He is Om. He is the meaning and purport of Om. He is the   
Pure Jnana form. He is tainteless, he is ever peaceful (and   
spreads peace), He is Sri Dakshinamurty. (Verse 13)   
The Guru is Brahma. The Guru is Vishnu. The Guru is Maheswara.   
This Guru is really Para Brahman. He is Sri Dakshinamurty.   
(Verse 14). This is actually from Guru Gita.   
He is the physician for the whole world. He cures the bhavaroga,   
the disease of worldly life. He is eternal and he is all knowledge of the  
universe. He is Sri Dakshinamurty. (Verse 15)   
He is placing his index finger at the bottom of the thumb, and   
is showing a handpose (Chinmudra). This is only to show the   
union of jiva and Brahman, leaving the three malams, impurities,   
represented by the remaining three fingers kept away. (Verse 16)   
Arunachala Siva.

## staying at Arunachala Asramam  
Author: jozia               Date: January 05, 2007, 03:41:03 PM

I have checked out both of these new web-sites and note that no-where does it  
mention whether it is still possible to stay at Arunachala Ashramam as in the  
past.   
Can one still do this ? (I haven't been there yet). And will the ashram still  
send-out taxis to the airport as in the past ?   
Thank you,   
Jozia

I think, you better contact Shri Ramanashramam authority. Here is the link to  
"Contact Us" page from the new site: http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/contactus.html   
That's what I did when I last visited the Ashramam.
