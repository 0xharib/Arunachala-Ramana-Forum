If Mankind conquers outer space we will have Star Wars.   
But if he conquers Inner Space we will have Peace on Earth

Insights will not remove Ego Mick, rather the oposite. Your vasanas will run  
their course and there is nothing you can do about them. Insights can either  
make life easier or they can boost Ego.

Insight   
IN SIGHT   
To see inwarldy   
the ego plays its games   
Makes things seem good or bad   
Not just vasanas but everything else will run its course   
Its predestined   
Does this mean no one must talk sense?

To talk wise or foolishly. It is all not in our hands.   
Everything goes as it should go. We must just get rid of the idea that we are  
the doers, that we have the freedom to make any choice. This is the real  
freedom.

That's a wonderful expression Mick. My take on that is that if all of us,  
especially those who believe that they are 'closer to God' stay silent and  
gain THAT Insight (Gyan Drushti), then there will be no violence, no  
terrorism. But, alas, there will be, because its easier to look out than in.  
Again, its Bhagavan Shivji's stated rule (Niyam) that good and evil must co-  
exist.

Hiya Hameed.   
If everything is going as it must, if it all happens automatically,   
Then it must be so for what I am saying here.   
A little poem what I wrote wiv me little brain!!   
Whatever you do or say.   
The world will go its way.   
The original post is actually about my atitude to science and the Western idea  
of what intelligence is.   
Until we are liberated we must make our way through the maze of the material  
world.   
To deal with the world, as it is, it is nescessary to have some concepts which  
let us cope with it, especially in relation to other people.   
I am aware that the doer is an illusion, its just a mental mechanism within  
us.   
Although I know that I have some efforts to make !!!   
Ramana said As all the things that happen only happen to the Ego and the Ego  
isnt real, then nothing ever happens!   
Also I think you are incorrect when you say Ramana merged with the Absolute  
when he died.   
He merged with the Absolute at the age of 16 and as he said there was no  
furher development.   
Also he exists! His grace exists! He said to pray without the sense of duality  
.So his grace is not experienced as, I and another.   
That would be imagination as you say!!   
He is my Guru. For me the greatest of all!   
Peace   
Mick H

Well im new to Ramana all i can say that the abundance between Space and you  
is wonderfull,Yes Love, Peace, Truth is all there but try and sit there for a  
split second and witness your self.That in it self is a CONQUEST...Even better  
we search for more space but stop looking for space and let it all be,we still  
need to experince being ORDINARY and not EXTRA ORDINARY in the Space we  
have....

Dear Mike,   
What you say might be completely right.   
Just about Ramana as guru. As long as there is Ego, there is interference in  
your receiving Bhagavan's grace. One drop of kerosine spoils a whole bucket  
of fresh milk, even the purest milk in Existence!   
Have a good day   
Hameed   
PS According to Bhagavan, "every action undertaken, every word spoken" is the  
result of a decision. Inquire where does this decision come from. Always the  
right decision is made and it is not in our hands, not even these words of  
mine to you. Nobody has ever made a mistake.

Hameed   
Surely if the ego is gone then all that is left is the Self. In this state  
there is no ego to recieve grace, because the Self itself is grace.   
The ending of the ego is the ending if I and it. The ending of the Experiencer  
and the Experienced.   
Samadhi is like becoming the universe, like being everywhere all at once, but  
with no localised "I" that can say I am having this experience. It struck me  
afterwards, that you cant really call it an experience, because it is both  
experience AND experiencer!   
Its just awareness that is Self Aware.   
Ramanas explanations are always so concise, so clear and to the point.He gets  
into a few words what most cannot get into many many books. How he explains  
that you cannot be aware of yourself in the same way as you are aware of an  
object because there would have to be two of you, seems to me to be the  
perfect explanation and to have a slight little taste of his humour as well!   
Peace!   
Mick.
