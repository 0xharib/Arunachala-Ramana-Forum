## "Time and Space are within you"

Ramana Maharishi said that time and space are within you.   
How about this metaphor.   
A clock.   
The clock does not move.   
The hands on the face of the clock move.   
The clock is the SELF.   
The hands are the EGO.   
When the hands stop moving all that is left is the SELF nd time stops!

Bhagavan said the same thing in the famous Screen-cinema show   
example.

It's stange, so strange, that the world that we see seemingly AROUND us is  
really a picture inside us.

You are right. Bhagavan also said that while in screen-cinema   
show, 'the seer' is outside the picture and the screen, in   
life-show, we are the 'the seer' and 'the screen'.

That's it !! The seer and the seen.   
Both on the screen !!   
It's breaking the identification with the seer that's so difficult !!   
Peace

Dear mick, further, in life, we have eat and excrete. In realization,   
we have to refuse the refuse and be the food. Is it not? Arunachala   
Siva.
