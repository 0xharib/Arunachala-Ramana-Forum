Hello everyone,   
My close friend and i follow perrenial philosophies, non-dualism and the  
teachings of Ramana very enthusiastically, we both feel the truth in its  
"concepts" although are also aware that what we feel is not reality lol...we  
spend alot of time together discussing perrenial phylosophies and appreciating  
various writings that we feel encompass teachings and examples of non-dualism  
and enjoy picking apart and interpreting writings together.   
Today we were talking and i refered to thought as formless and he disagreed  
and said that they were the exact opposite...thoughts are form...i could not  
understand this...i view that thoughts create form, but the form which they  
create is not reality and so therefore is not form...but you could also say  
that the form which thoughts create is not reality so therefore the form we  
percieve is a thought and by this point thoughts are form.   
As we experience thought in my mind, they have no form...they do not poo out  
of your ear as you have them, although i suppose each time we open our mouths  
to express them . ...LOL   
But to me this supports my understanding them as being formless. The thing  
is, he is incredibly wise...he is far better read than myself, so is more  
aquainted with the knowledge and teachings of perennial philosophies, non-  
dualism and Ramana Maharshi who he adores...in our conversation, i kind of got  
to grips with the point he was making, through logic and trust in his wide  
knowledge...but i still do not understand completely how my point is  
invalid...i still can not see how why in the one perspective thoughts are form  
this means that they can not be formless in their nature, experience.   
It is possible that i have gotten the state of my thoughts confused with  
consciousness, but i can not see either how this could be relavant.  
Consciousness is formless and infinate, unbindable...so surely anything that  
stems from it is formless also?   
Here is the conversation if you want to read it to give a better insight of  
where my friend was coming from, there may be a few bits that do not make  
sense, for me and he refer to things that we already understand and agree  
quite simplistically, i do not want to discuss these, i would like to  
understand how thoughts ARE form...the way he put it...or how thoughts ARE  
formless the way i view it...i would REALLY appreciate ANY quotes or teachings  
you could give me that may help resolve this and understand...   
A - one thing i disagree with and that is that thought is formless   
me - what?   
A - what we see and think is form   
me - mmm yes   
A - hence the point of transcending form. .. transcending thought   
me - yeah, but what we see and think is form, but our experience of thought  
is formless   
A - but the thought itself that we identify with is form   
me - l no   
A - but ya I agree that the consciousness is formless   
 think about it   
 the computer you are using   
me - it creates the thought of form   
A - it is a thought   
me - yes   
A - and it has a form   
me - no   
A - no?   
me - i think it has form. .. but in reality it hasnt   
A - in reality it transcends both form and formless I know that, but thought  
is form while we are identifying with the ego   
 because it has a certain shape. .. and distinction from other thought forms   
me - no. .. you think it has form. .. certain shape   
A - the thinking is the form   
me - the thinking creates form but it is not the form itself, for there is no  
form in reality   
A - the thinker and thought are one and the same   
 duality is form   
me - yes...and?   
A - hence the various multitudes of forms that manifest via duality   
... wait. .. let me show ya something   
me - hurry up though, i gotta go in a mo   
A - Thought cannot do what it will, free itself from opposites; thought  
itself created the ugly and the beautiful, the good and the bad. So it cannot  
free itself from its own activities. All that it can do is to be still, not  
choose. Choice is conflict. Jiddu   
me - yes. ..l and?   
A - we choose forms which is made of thought   
me - when thought is still it becomes its formless state   
A - but until then it is form   
me - no   
... the reality is its true state   
A - agree to disagree   
me - no   
.. ahaha   
A - and it is beyond the reach of thought   
me - l lets sort this out!   
A - because thought = form. .. also   
... there is form in infinity because infinity has everything   
me - but everything is nothing   
 there is form and there is no form   
A - and nothing is everything   
me - yes...but it is also nothing   
A - but thought is form while we see it in parts of a whole instead as just  
a whole   
me - dont equate that nothing being everything makes everything the stronger  
of the two   
A - thereis no difference between the two. .. both are concepts   
... concepts are thought   
... thought is form   
me -l yes, thought creates form in our minds...it interprets   
... but it is not the form itself   
... i do not understand why you can not see this?. .. it isnt the form it  
creates   
A - there is no difference between thought and form   
... they are the same   
me - it is the process that creates it   
A - the process is thought   
me - yes   
A - and it has form   
... true reality has no process. .. for it is ever as it should be   
me - it is the process that creates form, but not the form itself, for it  
does not exist...   
...it is just a thought...MMMM   
...l i might be getting you   
A - ultmately it is all illusion   
me - WOW!!! the way i worded that is MAAAAD   
A - but the illusion is thought. .. and the thoughts are various forms   
me - check the contradiction man   
 i still associate with the formless aspect   
A - even that is a thought   
me - what i said, yes   
A - true formlessness is beyond both formless and form   
me - yes   
A - my point is   
 thought is objective   
 or subjective. .. but they concepts. .. concepts are form   
me - l but the form isnt real   
A - doesnt matter   
me - whether we think them or not   
A - it is still form   
me - how...if it is not real?   
A - it may not exist but its non-existence is form   
me - i think my head does FUnny things that makes me understand it  
differently   
A - we all have that   
Even after this iteration, i get it, but i do not...reality is formless and  
unbindable, so on the one hand thought is an illusionary binding, like a  
veil...so how can a illusionary state have form, if you are aware of its true  
nature?...   
Thanks for reading i look forward to recieveing any help you can offer me...it  
will mean alot

Names and forms are illusory from the perspective of the absolute. But they  
are real for those of us stuck in duality. Being aware that the true nature of  
reality is nondual is quite different from realizing such nonduality. The  
former is an intellectual understanding only.   
Blah blah blah,

Cheers Blahmananda,   
Yes, you have worded that really well.   
So, if my friend understands non-duality and follows it as i do myself...why  
refer to thoughts=form...when he understands that reality is formless and the  
illusion of thought and form, formless also.   
However, what you have said does resolve this somewhat for me...but i would  
still really appreciate any quotes or teachings anyone has to offer on the  
matter   
Cheers   
Nell

mmm, yeah and also, isnt accepting that we have not realized nonduality some  
what sealing our own fate?. ...to experience the non-dual should we not  
surrender to the truths of the absolutes?...it just does not make sense to me.   
Is it like...only people who have "self realized" are allowed to express  
things in that way? . ..to me there is no idolising or divisiion to  
realisation, i live my life in a society of dualism but i know the illusionary  
paradox of this and the formlessness of thought is a more accurate description  
of what i experience than that of the dualistic interpretation.   
ha ha...sorry, just some more thought forms pooing out, thas all HAHAHAHA   
EDIT: WOWWWWW! Just realised! i've resolved it!!! If formlessness of thought  
is a more accirate description of what i experience then the original dispute  
is irrelavant YAY!

Thoughts exist in the chitta, the mindstuff. They come as either names or  
forms. Thoughts **are** the illusory world. The formless truth is not a  
thought. It is beyond thought. Still the mind and feel this. But how to still  
the mind? One method is to concentrate on a single thought only. When others  
arrive let them go and come back to the one thought. Eventually the thoughts  
get thinned out. In the end throw away the one thought too. Another is to  
watch the thoughts without being carried away by them. Rest in the eternal  
witness. This method also will thin out the thoughts. They are really the same  
method. Observing or concentrating on the breath is another method. This  
becomes the one thought of the first method. Concentrating on a chakra or an  
energy center in the subtle body is another method. These are all really the  
same method.   
Then there is the background of thought. Concentration and meditation must  
really be kept up constantly, even while engaging in the world. But who can do  
this right from the start? So study the Upanishads, the Gita, The Brahma  
Sutra, the Yoga Vasistha, etc. Knowledge or Jnana is developed. This generates  
a satvic (pure) "background of thought" that will help one remain as the  
witness even while engaging in worldly activity. The benefits of scripture  
cannot be understood unless one experiences the power of this background of  
thought.   
Also cultivate the heart. One should not be a "dry vedantist." Sankara was a  
supreme bhakti. Truth is Love. Merge the mind in the heart. But it doesn't  
matter really, for if one proceeds far enough on the path of knowledge, one  
discovers anyway that the highest nondual realization is pure Love.   
Blah blah blah,   
Blahmananda

thoughts are the aggitations which take place in our brains   
In Physics you come across what happens to molecular activity at 0 degree  
kelvin, **activity ceases**   
The same happens when you realise yourself who are you and what are you   
and the result is that your activity ceases and you thoughts cease   
Calm yourself by not thinking about all worldly things and meditate on the  
guru RAMANA   
and you will become silent

Just like to say hello to everyone here, I'm new to this forum.   
I personally have always felt that the sleep state was a no-thought state,  
i.e. a blank state and thus formless. However, I did read somewhere (can't  
find the article at this time) that Ramana said that sleep too was just  
another thought. If this is so, then wouldn't this make thought formless too?

Thoughts are formless. When mind-reader reads your thought,   
you or he does not perceive that it comes out of you and reaches   
him. But thoughts can produce forms, like the magician bringing   
rabbit out of his thought. Out of thoughts, names and forms   
appear simultaneosuly. Thinking about sleep is again a thought.   
But being in sleep is not a thought, because mind withdraws into   
the Self. But, when you dream, it is a thought and so names and   
forms appear. In a dream, as Bhagavan said, when you feel hungry,   
only the food in the dream can satisfy you. It has nothing to do   
with your waking state hunger and food to satisfy it.
