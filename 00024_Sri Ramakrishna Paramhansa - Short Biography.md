Sri Ramakrishna was born on 18 February 1836 in the village of Kamarpukur  
about sixty miles northwest of Kolkata. His parents, Kshudiram Chattopadhyaya  
and Chandramani Devi, were poor but very pious and virtuous. As a child,  
Ramakrishna (his childhood name was Gadadhar) was dearly loved by the  
villagers. From early days, he was disinclined towards formal education and  
worldly affairs. He was, however, a talented boy, and could sing and paint  
well. He was fond of serving holy men and listening to their discourses. He  
was also very often found to be absorbed in spiritual moods. At the age of  
six, he experienced the first ecstasy while watching a flight of white cranes  
moving against the background of black clouds. This tendency to enter into  
ecstasy intensified with age. His fathers death when he was seven years old  
served only to deepen his introspection and increase his detachment from the  
world.   
**As a Priest at Dakshineswar Temple**   
When Sri Ramakrishna was sixteen, his brother Ramkumar took him to Kolkata to  
assist him in his priestly profession. In 1855 the Kali Temple at Dakshineswar  
built by Rani Rasmani was consecrated and Ramkumar became the chief priest in  
that temple. When he died a few months later, Ramakrishna was appointed the  
priest. Ramakrishna developed intense devotion to Mother Kali and spent hours  
in loving adoration of her image, forgetting the rituals of priestly duties.  
His intense longing culminated in the vision of Mother Kali as boundless  
effulgence engulfing everything around him.   
**Intense Spiritual Practices**   
Sri Ramakrishnas God-intoxicated state alarmed his relatives in Kamarpukur  
and they got him married to Saradamani, a girl from the neighbouring village  
of Jayrambati. Unaffected by the marriage, Sri Ramakrishna plunged into even  
more intense spiritual practices. Impelled by a strong inner urge to  
experience different aspects of God he followed, with the help of a series of  
Gurus, the various paths described in the Hindu scriptures, and realized God  
through each of them. The first teacher to appear at Dakshineswar (in 1861)  
was a remarkable woman known as Bhairavi Brahmani who was an advanced  
spiritual adept, well versed in scriptures. With her help Sri Ramakrishna  
practised various difficult disciplines of the Tantrik path, and attained  
success in all of them. Three years later came a wandering monk by name  
Totapuri, under whose guidance Sri Ramakrishna attained Nirvikalpa Samadhi,  
the highest spiritual experience mentioned in the Hindu scriptures. He  
remained in that state of non-dual existence for six months without the least  
awareness of even his own body. In this way, Sri Ramakrishna relived the  
entire range of spiritual experiences of more than three thousand years of  
Hindu religion.   
**Following Other Faiths**   
With his unquenchable thirst for God, Sri Ramakrishna broke the frontiers of  
Hinduism, glided through the paths of Islam and Christianity, and attained the  
highest realization through each of them in a short span of time. He looked  
upon Jesus and Buddha as incarnations of God, and venerated the ten Sikh  
Gurus. He expressed the quintessence of his twelve-year-long spiritual  
realizations in a simple dictum: Yato mat, tato path As many faiths, so many  
paths. He now habitually lived in an exalted state of consciousness in which  
he saw God in all beings.   
 **Worshipping His Wife**   
In 1872, his wife Sarada, now nineteen years old, came from the village to  
meet him. He received her cordially, and taught her how to attend to household  
duties and at the same time lead an intensely spiritual life. One night he  
worshipped her as the Divine Mother in his room at the Dakshineswar temple.  
Although Sarada continued to stay with him, they lived immaculately pure  
lives, and their marital relationship was purely spiritual. It should be  
mentioned here that Sri Ramakrishna had been ordained a Sannyasin (Hindu  
monk), and he observed the basic vows of a monk to perfection. But outwardly  
he lived like a lay man, humble, loving and with childlike simplicity. During  
Sri Ramakrishnas stay at Dakshineswar, Rani Rasmani first acted as his  
patron. After her death, her son-in-law Mathur Nath Biswas took care of his  
needs.   
**Contact with Some Notables**   
Sri Ramakrishnas name as an illumined saint began to spread. Mathur once  
convened an assembly of scholars, and they declared him to be not an ordinary  
human being but the Avatar of the Modern Age. In those days the socio-  
religious movement known as Brahmo Samaj, founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, was  
at the height of popularity in Bengal. Sri Ramakrishna came into contact with  
several leaders and members of Brahmo Samaj and exerted much influence on  
them. His teaching on harmony of religions attracted people belonging to  
different denominations, and Dakshineswar became a veritable Parliament of  
Religions.   
 **Coming of the Devotees**   
As bees swarm around a fully blossomed flower, devotees now started coming to  
Sri Ramakrishna. He divided them into two categories. The first one consisted  
of householders. He taught them how to realize God while living in the world  
and discharging their family duties. The other more important category was a  
band of educated youths, mostly from the middle class families of Bengal, whom  
he trained to become monks and to be the torchbearers of his message to  
mankind. The foremost among them was Narendranath, who years later, as Swami  
Vivekananda, carried the universal message of Vedanta to different parts of  
the world, revitalized Hinduism, and awakened the soul of India.   
 **The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna**   
Sri Ramakrishna did not write any book, nor did he deliver public lectures.  
Instead, he chose to speak in a simple language using parables and metaphors  
by way of illustration, drawn from the observation of nature and ordinary  
things of daily use. His conversations were charming and attracted the  
cultural elite of Bengal. These conversations were noted down by his disciple  
Mahendranath Gupta who published them in the form of a book, Sri Sri  
Ramakrishna Kathamrita in Bengali. Its English rendering, The Gospel of Sri  
Ramakrishna, was released in 1942; it continues to be increasingly popular to  
this day on account of its universal appeal and relevance.   
 **Last Days**   
The intensity of his spiritual life and untiring spiritual ministration to the  
endless stream of seekers told on Sri Ramakrishna's health. He developed  
cancer of the throat in 1885. He was shifted to a spacious suburban villa  
where his young disciples nursed him day and night. He instilled in them love  
for one another, and thus laid the foundation for the future monastic  
brotherhood known as Ramakrishna Math. In the small hours of 16 August 1886  
Sri Ramakrishna gave up his physical body, uttering the name of the Divine  
Mother, and passed into Eternity.

Dear prasanth,   
Sri Ramakrishna was soaked in bhakti and did Advaita Sadhana   
with that juice of bhakti.   
Arunachala Siva.
