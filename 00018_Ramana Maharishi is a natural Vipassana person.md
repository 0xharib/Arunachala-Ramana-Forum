I consider Ramana Maharishi as a natural Vipassi. In Vipassana one has to  
meditate and meditate continously then one gets enlightenment. But in his case  
may be over lifetimes after lifetimes in his past lives he might have  
spiritually so evovled that in his this life he had to just sit for half an  
hour and he just attained it. I am a great admirer of his soul, how kind and  
humane his soul was.

Could be he was already enlightened and his love for all beings brought him  
here.   
Like the way he allowed himself to physically travel help Gnapati Sastri  
[page 96 Ramana Maharishi and the path of self knowledge by Arthur Osbourne]   
He didnt say to himself I will use occult powers to travel to help Sastrri, he  
just let himself be transported there because there was a need.   
This I believe is the clue to his incarnation.   
 He was ALREADY ENLIGHTENED,   
 He simply allowed the incarnation as Venkataraman. He allowed the ego to form  
and the young man to reach a certian age, whilst the brain and mind were  
programmed.   
When this was done that Great Soul took over and the incarnation as Ramana  
began.   
If we look at his whole life it followed this pattern,   
He never sought to be a Guru yet being one just happened without him making a  
conscoius effort to be one.   
He never sought fame, and yet fame just happened.   
So I reckon thats how he came into the world!!   
He was drawn here because there was/is a need for him. Not of his own  
volition, but out of his all abding love!!

I wonder about reincarnation. If everything is one consciousness, what is it  
that reincarnates? The memory does not move onto the next life, and the  
individual as a separate entity seems to be a mental construct. To me,  
reincarnation does not seem to be a useful idea. Anyone else have an opinion,  
for or against?

What makes you say that the memory doesnt pass to the next life?   
They are there hidden beyond the ego.   
Its difficult to remmember what one did last month or 10 years ago!! This  
doesnt mean that the memoreis arent there, it just means that they are not  
readily accessible.   
Its seems that the identification "I am the body" prevents them being found.   
It seems that in each lifetime we believe that we are this particular person  
,this body, these thoughts.   
Ramana said that becoming enlightened was "Like waking from a dream of  
wandering all over the world"   
As to the all one consciousness thing, well maybe the raindrop still stays  
itself even when it disolves into the ocean.

memories are a function of the brain, when it dies those memories die also.   
what we think is the self is a thought, a story the brain tells, and it also  
will die when the brain dies so there is really no self to reincarnate.   
reincarnation is not personal but only seems to be when viewed from a personal  
perspective.   
as for enlightenment. .. ramana was already enlightened, yes, just as we all  
are. to see this, just as ramana did, we have only to stop believing that  
we are not.

If memories were merely a function of the brain, then how could anyone recall  
past lives?   
Reincarnation is the most personal thing that happens to us. Each time we  
identify with the new body and suffer all its pains, know its loves. die its  
deaths, fight its wars. Buddha said Verily you have shed more blood than are  
in the oceans.   
Reincarnation is the single biggest incentive to try hard at meditation. Cos  
if you dont make it this time then yooos is coming back for another dose  
.Could be in a war zone, or with a horrible disease, or any of the awful  
things that happen to us when we fall into Samasara   
Maybe the brain is the organ of the retrival of memory but it is plainly not  
the storehouse.   
Ramana said becoming enlightened was like a dream of wandering all over the  
world.   
The dream being all the previous lives, which he knew were only like dreams.   
He also said, As everything that happens happens only to the Ego, then nothing  
ever happens.   
Look at the page 193. Chapter 18. Reincarnation. Of Be As You Are THE  
TEACHINGS OF SRI RAMANA MAHARISHI, by David Godman.   
Here you will find Ramanas teaching on reincarnation.   
Also you might investigate the Yogic idea of Akashic Cliches, which explain  
transpersonal memories.
